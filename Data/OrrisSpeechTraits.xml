<trait name="Pit Fiend Obsessive" priority="50">
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>What do I do? Some call me a scholar, others a doomsayer. I study the most terrible of infernal beings: the pit fiends.</line>
    <line>To most, they are nightmares; to me, an obsession—equal parts fascination and fury. Ask me about pit fiends if you crave a real horror.</line>
    <line>My entire life’s work has circled one question: how does one outwit a pit fiend? Go on—ask about pit fiends.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="pit fiend">
    <line>Pit fiends are the tyrants of the underworld—massive, cunning, insatiable. Their wings darken the air; their breath, fire itself.</line>
    <line>To know a pit fiend is to court destruction. Only fools and fanatics seek them out. Yet here I am.</line>
    <line>My knowledge is deep, my hatred deeper. If you’re truly curious, inquire about their habits.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>Pit fiends savor cruelty. They relish torment, and above all, they crave the scent of burning knowledge.</line>
    <line>They do not simply kill; they *ruin*. Libraries, temples, hopes—all ash before their passage.</line>
    <line>If you would understand their essence, ask me about fire. It is their herald and their signature.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Fire is the pit fiend’s language. It speaks in roars, it writes in smoke.</line>
    <line>I lost my most treasured possession to their flame. Ask about my library, if you would know true loss.</line>
    <line>Their fire devours everything—especially what we love. My library paid the price. Ask me about it, if you care.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="library">
    <line>My library was my life: rare tomes, ancient scrolls, wisdom gleaned from decades. All consumed in one night by a pit fiend’s wrath.</line>
    <line>I watched helpless as flame erased centuries of knowledge. The pit fiend left only cinders—and me, swearing vengeance.</line>
    <line>Some things can never be replaced. Others can be avenged. If you believe in justice, ask about revenge.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="revenge">
    <line>Revenge is the only answer left. Will you help me end the reign of a pit fiend? If you’re truly brave, say ‘slay’.</line>
    <line>I have hunted knowledge my whole life; now I hunt a monster. Help me close the chapter—speak the word ‘slay’ if you’re ready.</line>
    <line>One pit fiend stands between me and peace. Say ‘slay’, and we begin the final act.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="slay"
         itemType="KillQuestScroll"
         ctorArgs="PitFiend,1,1000">
    <line>Take this scroll—bring me proof that a pit fiend lies dead. Only then can I rebuild from the ashes.</line>
    <line>The task is simple in words, deadly in deed: slay one pit fiend. Return to me with the scroll as proof.</line>
    <line>The infernal tyrant awaits. Let your courage burn hotter than their flames.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <!-- 24 Red Herring/Flavor Entries -->
  
  <entry keyword="devil">
    <line>Not all devils are pit fiends, but every pit fiend is the devil’s worst nightmare made flesh.</line>
    <line>The hierarchy of hell is complicated. Pit fiends are always at the top, gnashing their teeth.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="wings">
    <line>Pit fiend wings blot out hope and sunlight alike.</line>
    <line>Those wings carry them above the battlefield, and sometimes into your nightmares.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="brimstone">
    <line>The scent of brimstone is their calling card—if you smell it, run.</line>
    <line>Brimstone seeps from their skin. It lingers for days after they’ve passed.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="ash">
    <line>My home is layered with ash. I sweep and sweep, but the memory remains.</line>
    <line>Ash is a poor replacement for parchment and ink.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="contract">
    <line>Pit fiends delight in breaking contracts, usually in the most dramatic fashion.</line>
    <line>Never trust a devil’s bargain. Especially not when flames are involved.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="horns">
    <line>Pit fiend horns are sharp enough to carve runes—and fates.</line>
    <line>They polish their horns with the bones of the defeated, or so I’ve read.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="inferno">
    <line>An inferno is a pit fiend’s signature—bold, brash, impossible to ignore.</line>
    <line>I once mistook a campfire for a fiend’s inferno. I ran anyway.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="fear">
    <line>Fear is their ally. The scent of it draws them like moths to flame.</line>
    <line>To confront a pit fiend is to swallow your fear, or be consumed by it.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="binding">
    <line>Legend says pit fiends can be bound, but only by the cleverest sorcerers—and even then, not for long.</line>
    <line>I wouldn’t trust any chain to hold them. Not even the chains of memory.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="talon">
    <line>Pit fiend talons slice through armor and hope alike.</line>
    <line>Many have tried to collect a pit fiend talon as a trophy. Few return with fingers attached.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="curse">
    <line>Pit fiends don’t need to curse you. Their presence is curse enough.</line>
    <line>I’ve studied curses all my life. None compare to the pit fiend’s legacy.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="torch">
    <line>Torches won’t help against pit fiends. Their flames are hungrier than yours.</line>
    <line>I used to think fire was my friend. Now, I see it for the traitor it is.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="armor">
    <line>Pit fiend scales are harder than steel and twice as cruel.</line>

  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="demon">
    <line>Demons and pit fiends are rivals, but neither has mercy for mortals.</line>
    <line>Pit fiends scoff at demon tricks. They prefer brute force—and it works.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="spell">
    <line>Spells can slow a pit fiend, but never stop them. Knowledge is your true weapon.</line>
    <line>I’ve tried every spell in the books. Books burn quickly.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="ember">
    <line>I find embers everywhere—on my clothes, in my dreams.</line>
    <line>Each ember a memory of what I’ve lost.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="scroll">
    <line>Scrolls are precious, yet fragile. I learned that the hard way.</line>
    <line>If you ever see a scroll scorched black, know a pit fiend passed that way.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="tongue">
    <line>Pit fiend tongues are forked and venomous—don’t listen, don’t bargain.</line>
    <line>If a pit fiend speaks, you’d better be running, not listening.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="abyss">
    <line>The abyss is home to many horrors. Pit fiends are its crowned kings.</line>
    <line>Stare too long into the abyss, and you’ll see a pit fiend staring back.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="char">
    <line>Charred pages, charred dreams. That’s all the fiend left me.</line>
    <line>If only I could unburn a single book.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="molten">
    <line>They walk where the earth is molten, where only nightmares flourish.</line>
    <line>Molten rock is their carpet. Walk lightly around such places.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="grudge">
    <line>Some hold grudges. Mine is a conflagration.</line>
    <line>A grudge against a pit fiend is dangerous, but I refuse to let go.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>Chains bind most things. Pit fiends break chains for amusement.</line>

  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="sigil">
    <line>Sigils of warding? Child’s play to a pit fiend.</line>

<trait name="Pixie Scholar" priority="40">
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>My profession? I am a scholar of the fae. Pixies, in particular, are my lifelong study—and torment.</line>
    <line>I’ve devoted decades to cataloguing their tricks, pranks, and peculiarities. Ask me about pixies, if you’re curious—or foolhardy.</line>
    <line>Some call me obsessed, others “the pixie prophet.” The truth is less glamorous. Pixies haunt my every thought. Ask about pixies, if you dare.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pixie">
    <line>Pixies are not the innocent sprites bards sing about. Mischief runs in their blood like wine.</line>
    <line>Their wings shimmer, their laughter enchants, but don’t let your guard down. Pixies delight in tormenting mortals.</line>
    <line>I once admired their beauty and wit. Now, I study their chaos. If you’re brave, ask me about their pranks.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="prank">
    <line>Pranks are a pixie’s art form—mischief elevated to mastery. Wet boots, missing coins, potions swapped for pond water.</line>
    <line>I’ve catalogued hundreds of pixie pranks. But some, like the honey incident, are best forgotten.</line>
    <line>If you’ve ever woken up with blue hair or missing eyebrows, you’ve met a pixie’s handiwork. Their favorite target? My research, always. Curious about the honey incident?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="honey">
    <line>Honey and pixies are an explosive combination. They adore it, hoard it, and use it in their cruelest tricks.</line>
    <line>My greatest humiliation involved a stolen honey jar, a swarm of angry bees, and far too many witnesses.</line>
    <line>I lost more than pride that day. Ask about what I lost, if you wish to understand my enmity.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="loss">
    <line>I lost my reputation, my favorite hat, and my place at the academy, all in one sticky afternoon.</line>
    <line>But the true loss? My notes—years of research, scattered to the wind by laughing pixies.</line>
    <line>Now I seek more than revenge. I seek to reclaim my honor. Will you help me punish them? Ask me about vengeance.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vengeance">
    <line>Vengeance is a scholar’s privilege—especially against pixie-kind. I need proof of their downfall.</line>
    <line>Ten pixie wings, plucked from their cruelest tricksters. Are you ready to hunt them for me? Simply say ‘hunt’.</line>
    <line>No fae charm can mend what’s broken. Bring me wings. If you wish to begin, say ‘hunt’.</line>
  </entry>

         itemType="KillQuestScroll"
         ctorArgs="Pixie,10,700">
    <line>Bring me ten pixie wings—only then can I rest easy. Take this scroll, and let justice flutter on the wind.</line>
    <line>Words alone won’t reclaim my honor. This scroll will help you count your victories. Ten pixies. Ten wings. Return to me.</line>
    <line>No mercy for tricksters—hunt them down, and let their wings be the price of peace.</line>

  <!-- 24 Red Herring Entries (flavorful, thematic, and hinting at the world or fae culture) -->
  <entry keyword="fairy">
    <line>Fairies and pixies are cousins, but fairies have a sense of decorum. Pixies? None whatsoever.</line>
    <line>Never confuse the two—a fairy may help you. A pixie will braid spiders into your hair.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hat">
    <line>My favorite hat—purple, feathered, and now somewhere in the pixie realm, I suppose.</line>
    <line>Pixies love hats. The more flamboyant, the faster it disappears.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="academy">
    <line>The Academy of Arcane Sciences. Once my home. Now they laugh whenever I mention honey.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wings">
    <line>Pixie wings are delicate—iridescent, gossamer, and much too quick for most mortals to catch.</line>
    <line>I’ve heard tales of mages weaving spells with a single pixie wing. I only need ten, for vengeance.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bees">
    <line>Bees and pixies make a dreadful alliance. Never, ever leave a honey jar unattended in the wild.</line>
    <line>The buzzing still haunts me on quiet nights. That, and laughter.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trick">
    <line>A trick from a pixie is like a riddle—sometimes clever, always humiliating.</line>
    <line>They once convinced a whole village to dance naked in the rain. Harmless, but unforgettable.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="laughter">
    <line>The laughter of pixies is high, musical, and always at your expense.</line>
    <line>To a pixie, a belly laugh is worth a thousand gold coins.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spite">
    <line>Pixies run on spite and honey. Sometimes I think they remember every insult ever thrown their way.</line>
    <line>I tried to ignore them once. That only made things worse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blue">
    <line>Why blue? Because that’s the color pixies prefer for hair dye and dyeing rivers. Beware blue ponds.</line>
    <line>My beard was blue for a month. The dye never did come out.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>Sleep is dangerous where pixies roam. You might wake up somewhere new, or not at all.</line>
    <line>I once awoke dangling from a tree, tied up with ribbons. Pixies, of course.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Never look in a mirror after angering pixies. You may not like what you see.</line>
    <line>They love to enchant reflections—sometimes, your reflection will wink back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>Pixies play music on dewdrops and spiderwebs. Lovely, if you like your lullabies with a side of chaos.</line>
    <line>I once tried to outplay a pixie fiddler. Lost my shoes and my dignity.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>The moon is said to be a doorway for fae mischief. Never leave honey out during a full moon.</line>
    <line>On full moon nights, the pixie lights dance in the woods. Best to stay indoors.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>Pixies stole my ink once. They replaced it with beetle juice. My letters still smell foul.</line>
    <line>Never trust a well-stocked writing desk in fae country.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flower">
    <line>Pixies hide in blossoms and petals. Pluck a flower, risk a bite on the nose.</line>
    <line>I’ve learned to leave wildflowers be. Some things are best left undisturbed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="candle">
    <line>A pixie’s favorite game? Blowing out candles at the worst possible moment.</line>
    <line>Buy lanterns, not candles, if you want to read in pixie territory.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="riddle">
    <line>Pixies speak in riddles. If you answer wrong, expect to lose something—your shoes, your voice, or your wits.</line>
    <line>I keep a riddle book, but it’s never enough.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="apple">
    <line>Pixies can’t resist a shiny apple. Nor can I, if I’m honest.</line>
    <line>One bite, and you might fall asleep for a week. Or wake up covered in feathers.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feather">
    <line>I found my bed stuffed with pixie feathers once. Itchy, colorful, and impossible to remove.</line>
    <line>They shed everywhere, those winged fiends.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ring">
    <line>Pixie rings—those circles of mushrooms—are best avoided. Step inside, and you may never step out again.</line>
    <line>I’ve circled them with salt, just to be sure.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="salt">
    <line>Salt wards off lesser fae, but pixies treat it as seasoning.</line>
    <line>They once filled my boots with salt. I’m still finding grains in the seams.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pond">
    <line>Ponds and lakes are favorite pixie haunts. Beware strange ripples and floating lanterns.</line>

    <line>I have a collection of mismatched shoes, courtesy of pixie mischief.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- STEP 1 -->
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>What do I do? I am a scholar and a sworn adversary of the Plague Beasts.</line>
    <line>I study their biology, their habits—and their cruelties. Some call me obsessed. I call it necessary.</line>
    <line>If you’re curious about Plague Beasts, ask me. If you’re wise, you’ll run the other way.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- STEP 2 -->
  <entry keyword="plaguebeast">
    <line>Plague Beasts are walking nightmares. Their flesh festers with toxins, their steps rot the very earth.</line>
    <line>They are nature’s mistake, stitched together from disease and hunger. I track their migrations, and their victims.</line>
    <line>Most fear their bite. Fools fear only the obvious. Their true danger is in their toxin. Ask me about it, if you dare.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- STEP 3 -->
  <entry keyword="toxin">
    <line>Their toxin seeps from every pore, every wound. It corrupts the soil, blights the air.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen plants wither from a single drop. The unlucky become victims—ask me about victims, if you wish to understand my hatred.</line>
    <line>Even the strongest warriors fall. You’ll find the truth in their victims. Ask about them.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- STEP 4 -->
  <entry keyword="victim">
    <line>I lost more than study subjects to the Plague Beasts. My companion, the loyal hound Briar, perished to their toxin.</line>
    <line>I’ve buried friends, neighbors, even kin, all lost to that abomination’s rot. Some say it’s fate. I say it’s murder.</line>
    <line>If only I’d found the remedy sooner... Ah, yes. The remedy. Ask me about it, and you’ll see the depths of my regret.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- STEP 5 -->
  <entry keyword="remedy">
    <line>The remedy is rare—hard-won from bitter root and silverleaf. It soothes the flesh, but not the soul.</line>
    <line>With it, I saved a few. Too few. The rest... their memories burn in me, fueling my vengeance.</line>
    <line>Yes, vengeance. The only cure left. Ask me, if you wish to share my crusade.</line>

  <!-- 24 Red Herrings / Flavor Entries -->
  <entry keyword="dog">
    <line>Briar was the bravest hound—never flinched from a beast twice his size. He deserved a better end.</line>
    <line>They say dogs can smell evil. Briar never barked—he just stared and growled when plague was near.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rot">
    <line>The scent of rot clings to Plague Beasts like a cloak. If you smell decay, flee—unless you’re hunting.</line>
    <line>I once found a patch of earth that would never bloom again, all thanks to their rot.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mutation">
    <line>No two Plague Beasts are the same. Tumors, twisted limbs, extra eyes—I catalog them all. Disgusting work.</line>
    <line>Some whisper that they’re born from magical accidents. I think it’s the world’s way of reminding us of chaos.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blight">
    <line>Blight follows them like a shadow. Crops fail, trees blacken. Even stone cracks at their passing, or so it seems.</line>
    <line>Every year, the blight grows. My notes grow with it, page after page of sorrow.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ooze">
    <line>Ooze drips from their wounds, hissing where it falls. I’ve bottled it, but never found a use—unless you count nightmares.</line>
    <line>Once, a drop of ooze burned through my glove. I still bear the mark.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="swamp">
    <line>Swamps hide many horrors, but none more persistent than the Plague Beast. It is their throne room, their nursery.</line>
    <line>I mapped a swamp once—came back with more questions and a rash that never healed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fungus">
    <line>Fungus sprouts in their footprints. Some glows green, some screams when burned. None are edible—trust me.</line>
    <line>I once mistook a rare mushroom for a cure. Instead, it made the sickness worse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="breath">
    <line>Their breath is foul enough to curl iron. If you’re downwind, count yourself unlucky.</line>
    <line>I heard a tale of a man who survived their bite, but not their breath.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scream">
    <line>The scream of a Plague Beast chills the soul. Some say it’s the last echo of all they’ve devoured.</line>
    <line>One night, I heard their scream in my dreams—and woke to find my lantern dimmed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nest">
    <line>They build nests from bones, mud, and rotten cloth. I’ve found them in old barns and abandoned crypts.</line>
    <line>If you stumble into a nest, walk backwards—slowly, silently. Then run.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="stinger">
    <line>Some Plague Beasts wield stingers like scorpions. I keep a jar of them—curiosity, not pride.</line>
    <line>If you see a stinger, keep your distance. The toxin there is the deadliest of all.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="legend">
    <line>Legends say Plague Beasts once served a mad king. If so, his kingdom must have reeked of death.</line>
    <line>Some legends are cautionary. With Plague Beasts, even legends aren’t enough warning.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>Some nights, the Plague Beasts howl at the moon. I’ve charted their cycles—never found a pattern.</line>
    <line>On full moons, their activity increases. Or perhaps that’s just my sleeplessness talking.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="alchemist">
    <line>I’ve traded notes with alchemists, all seeking a cure. None have succeeded—yet.</line>
    <line>Alchemists promise much. Plague Beasts deliver only suffering.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>I wear my scars as warnings to others: beware the things that fester in darkness.</line>
    <line>Every scar is a lesson. Most hurt, some itch, all remind me why I fight.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mire">
    <line>There’s no clean way through a mire, only paths of least regret. Plague Beasts thrive where others sink.</line>
    <line>If you find yourself lost in a mire, pray it’s only the mud that slows you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="harvest">
    <line>Farmers dread the harvest if Plague Beasts roam—the grain withers, and so does hope.</line>
    <line>I once helped with a harvest after a plague. All we gathered were dead stalks.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="talon">
    <line>Their talons can shred armor like parchment. I keep a few as morbid souvenirs.</line>
    <line>Each talon bears a unique twist—like a signature, or a curse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="witch">
    <line>Witches avoid Plague Beasts, or so they claim. I suspect even magic finds them distasteful.</line>
    <line>One witch told me she could cure their poison. She vanished that night.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cloak">
    <line>I wear a cloak of oiled leather—it repels the worst of their spittle, but not the smell.</line>
    <line>A good cloak is a scholar’s shield. Better if it covers your nose.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wound">
    <line>A wound from a Plague Beast festers fast. If you’re bitten, run for help—and pray.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen wounds that weep green. No bandage holds back that corruption for long.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>They linger in shadows, moving only when least expected. I trust only fire to keep them at bay.</line>
    <line>Every shadow might hide a Plague Beast. It’s the price of vigilance—and paranoia.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="curse">
    <line>Some say Plague Beasts are curses given form. If so, who cursed us? And how do we lift it?</line>
    <line>I’ve tried to break their curse with words, with charms, with steel. Only steel ever worked.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="herb">
    <line>I collect herbs to ward off sickness, but nothing wards off a Plague Beast except sharp steel.</line>
    <line>Silverleaf is said to purify tainted wounds, but it’s rare—and not always enough.</line>

    <line>PlagueRats are vermin touched by misery itself—fur streaked with soot, eyes fever-bright.</line>
    <line>No ordinary rat carries death as willingly. PlagueRats thrive where sickness festers, and where kindness fails.</line>
    <line>All my studies began the night I lost my dearest friend to their bite. If you care, ask about my friend.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="friend">
    <line>He was a ferret, nimble and bold, my truest companion in the hunt against the rats.</line>
    <line>Swiftpaw—quick of mind and gentle of heart. He never lost a battle—until the PlagueRats found him.</line>
    <line>I watched helpless as fever claimed him. He was more than a pet—he was hope itself. Ask me about Swiftpaw if you wish to hear more.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="swiftpaw">
    <line>Swiftpaw never feared the dark or the crawling masses. He chased them through every tunnel and gutter.</line>
    <line>He saved me thrice from the teeth of the PlagueRats. In the end, it was not their teeth, but their disease that slew him.</line>
    <line>I swore revenge for Swiftpaw. Ask me about disease, if you dare.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="disease">
    <line>Disease is the PlagueRat’s greatest weapon. Their bite brings fever, their fleas carry rot.</line>
    <line>I study their symptoms, hoping for a cure—yet each experiment brings only sorrow.</line>
    <line>If you wish to fight PlagueRats, you must understand where their disease breeds. Ask me about their nests.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nest">
    <line>Their nests are cesspits—piles of rags, bones, and rotting things hidden in the darkest cellars.</line>
    <line>One nest can poison a village. The stench alone is a warning—never enter unprepared.</line>
    <line>If you have the courage, perhaps you would help me take vengeance. Say ‘vengeance’ if you are ready to hunt PlagueRats.</line>

    <line>PlagueRats cough and wheeze as they spread their doom.</line>

  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>I am a myrmecologist—an ant scholar, ant lover, and, in the case of Red Solen, ant nemesis.</line>
    <line>Some think I merely collect them. The truth is, I study their every move and lament their every intrusion.</line>
    <line>Ask me about ants or—if you dare—the Red Solen. My feelings are… complicated.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ant">
    <line>Ants are marvels: tireless builders, cunning warriors, masterful thieves.</line>
    <line>I once admired every kind—until the Red Solen destroyed my life's work. Ask me about the Red Solen, if you wish.</line>
    <line>Every colony is a universe. But Red Solen colonies are nightmares. Speak their name, if you must.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="red solen">
    <line>The Red Solen are no ordinary ants. They're ruthless, cunning, and always hungry.</line>
    <line>They tunneled through my apiary, devoured my honeycombs, and made a feast of my bees.</line>
    <line>Ask about their tunnels, if you wonder how they invade. Or ask about honey, if you care for tragedy.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tunnel">
    <line>Their tunnels are endless, winding webs beneath our feet. You hear them sometimes—scratching, shifting the earth.</line>
    <line>One day, I followed a tunnel deep under my garden. All I found was ruin and a sticky trail.</line>
    <line>If you wish to know true loss, ask about honey. If you wish to know true danger, ask about queens.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="honey">
    <line>My prized honey—gone. The Red Solen broke into my hives, swarmed the combs, and carried it all underground.</line>
    <line>Do you know what it’s like to see thousands of ants shimmering with golden nectar, fleeing down a hole?</line>
    <line>I swore vengeance that day. Ask me how I might be avenged, if you seek a task worthy of an exterminator.</line>

    <line>This scroll marks your vengeance. Return when the Red Solen Worker menace is lessened—by ten.</line>

  <!-- 24 Red Herring / Flavor Keywords -->
  <entry keyword="colony">
    <line>Every ant colony is a city with secrets. The Red Solen build labyrinths none have fully mapped.</line>
    <line>I mapped a colony once. Came back missing a boot and my sense of direction.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="queen">
    <line>The queen is the heart of the colony. If you meet her, it means you’re too deep—or too late.</line>
    <line>I dream of finding the Red Solen queen. In my dreams, she always wins.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="soldier">
    <line>Soldier ants wield jaws like shears. The Red Solen soldiers especially—avoid their bite.</line>
    <line>I once saw a soldier ant drag a mouse by the tail. I wish I hadn’t.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="acid">
    <line>Red Solen ants spray acid when angered. My boots bear the scars—and my nostrils the memory.</line>
    <line>I tried bottling their acid. The bottle did not survive.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="carapace">
    <line>Red Solen carapaces gleam like burnished copper—beautiful, but tough as boiled leather.</line>
    <line>I tried making a necklace from their carapaces. Too many legs, not enough patience.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hive">
    <line>A bee hive is a masterpiece. An ant nest is a warning.</line>
    <line>Never place a beehive near an ant nest. Trust me, I learned the hard way.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bee">
    <line>Bees are my allies—gentle, industrious, tragically delicious to Red Solen.</line>
    <line>I mourn my bees more than my lost honey.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="garden">
    <line>My garden once bloomed with flowers and bees. Now? Just holes. Endless, infuriating holes.</line>
    <line>Ants aerate the soil, they say. Red Solen destroy it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mandible">
    <line>Red Solen mandibles are sharp enough to slice parchment—or fingers. Don’t ask how I know.</line>
    <line>The click of mandibles in the dark is a sound I’ll never forget.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sugar">
    <line>A single crystal of sugar will summon a parade of ants. Red Solen prefer more… substantial fare.</line>
    <line>Once dropped a sack of sugar. Didn’t see the ground for a week.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scout">
    <line>Scout ants find weakness in every defense. Red Solen scouts found mine before I even knew I had any.</line>
    <line>If you spot a lone Red Solen, more are coming. Always more.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mushroom">
    <line>Some ants farm mushrooms underground. Red Solen eat anything—including mushrooms, roots, and my patience.</line>
    <line>Never trust a mushroom with bite marks. Ants get hungry too.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dirt">
    <line>I sweep dirt from my doorstep every morning. Each pile, a sign the Red Solen tunneled closer.</line>
    <line>Once, I tried to fill their tunnels with dirt. I woke to find it piled neatly on my pillow.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="swarm">
    <line>The swarm is terrifying—waves of red, unstoppable and silent.</line>
    <line>Nothing halts a Red Solen swarm. Not fire, not water, not tears.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="larva">
    <line>Red Solen larvae are pale, wriggling things—future terrors in miniature.</line>
    <line>I rescued a larva once. It ate my bread and then vanished.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wing">
    <line>When the winged ones emerge, the sky darkens and the town locks its doors.</line>
    <line>Red Solen wings are translucent—fragile, but more intimidating than any thundercloud.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="egg">
    <line>Ant eggs are precious to the colony. Red Solen guard theirs with murderous zeal.</line>
    <line>Steal a Red Solen egg, and you’ll have the entire nest after you. I don’t recommend it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bite">
    <line>A Red Solen bite stings for days. I wear thick gloves, and still they find my skin.</line>
    <line>The pain fades. The memory does not.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trophy">
    <line>I kept a jar of Red Solen legs as trophies. My neighbor moved out shortly after.</line>
    <line>Ant trophies are only impressive to those who know the struggle.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flood">
    <line>Some flood ant nests with water. Red Solen simply float to higher tunnels, mockingly dry.</line>
    <line>I tried flooding a nest once. My basement has never been the same.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pheromone">
    <line>Pheromones guide the ants’ every step. I once tried masking their trail—just made them angry.</line>
    <line>Red Solen pheromones smell like vinegar and vengeance.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sand">
    <line>Sand clogs their tunnels, but they always dig free. I admire their stubbornness, even as I curse it.</line>
    <line>There’s always sand in my boots. Ants, too, sometimes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>The shadows move, sometimes. That’s when I know the Red Solen are near.</line>
    <line>Watch for shifting shadows—ants never walk alone.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>Some say ants respond to music. The Red Solen do—they march faster when I play my lute.</line>
    <line>I serenaded a nest once. They answered with a swarm.</line>

<trait name="Reptalon Scholar" priority="40">
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>I am a scholar of the rare and ruinous Reptalon—dragonkind’s mysterious cousin.</line>
    <line>I study their habits, their haunts, their appetite for chaos. Some say I’m obsessed, but they don’t know the half of it.</line>
    <line>If you wish to know true heartbreak, ask me about Reptalons.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="reptalon">
    <line>Reptalons: scales like sapphires, talons sharp as heartbreak. To scholars, a marvel. To me, a nightmare made flesh.</line>
    <line>There’s nothing quite like a Reptalon—part dragon, part riddle, all destruction.</line>
    <line>To understand them is to risk everything. Perhaps you’d ask about their habits?</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>Reptalons soar at dawn, sleep at noon, and hunt at dusk. They collect only the rarest treasures—and savor the taste of the forbidden.</line>
    <line>Their habits are erratic, yet strangely ritualistic. Nothing is sacred when a Reptalon is near.</line>
    <line>Of all their habits, their hunger for magical flora is the most ruinous. Would you know more of these plants?</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="plants">
    <line>My life was dedicated to nurturing rare magical plants—a garden of impossible wonders.</line>
    <line>Mandrake vines, night-blooming azurite, even the elusive ember lily—all lost to a single night of Reptalon hunger.</line>
    <line>If only I’d protected my garden better. The destruction was total. Ask me about the garden, if you have the heart.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="garden">
    <line>It was my pride—a sanctuary for every plant unfit for ordinary earth. Each blossom, a story; each vine, a hope.</line>
    <line>And then the Reptalon came. It tore through the wards, shattered the glass, and feasted on magic itself.</line>
    <line>I mourn the garden still. Yet what I mourn most is the loss of the ember lily. Ask about it, if you wish.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="ember lily">
    <line>The ember lily blooms once a decade, shedding petals that burn with living fire. My last, my rarest, devoured in a single gulp.</line>
    <line>To lose the ember lily is to lose a piece of my soul. Only vengeance can soothe such pain. Will you help me seek it? Type ‘vengeance’ if you will.</line>
    <line>The Reptalon must pay for what it’s done. If you are willing, speak the word: vengeance.</line>

    <line>You have my blessing—and this scroll to track your deed. Slay the Reptalon, and may the embers guide your blade.</line>
    <line>Words will not mend what was lost, but Reptalon blood may sow seeds of hope once more. Go!</line>
  </entry>
  
  <!-- 24 Red Herrings / Flavor Keywords -->
  <entry keyword="dragon">
    <line>Dragons are elegant destroyers—Reptalons, on the other hand, are chaos given wings.</line>
    <line>Some say Reptalons are lesser dragons. I say they are more dangerous for their unpredictability.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="egg">
    <line>Reptalon eggs are coveted by fools and fortune-seekers alike. I once sought one—never again.</line>
    <line>They say a single Reptalon egg can buy a kingdom or doom a village.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="scale">
    <line>A Reptalon’s scale is impervious to most blades, yet delicate enough to shimmer in moonlight.</line>
    <line>I kept a scale once—until it vanished. They always find what’s theirs.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="talon">
    <line>A swipe from a Reptalon’s talon can shatter steel. I have scars that whisper caution.</line>
    <line>Some fools collect Reptalon talons. I prefer to keep my limbs.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="wing">
    <line>Their wings thunder like storm clouds. When you hear that sound, run.</line>
    <line>A Reptalon’s wingspan eclipses the sun—or so it seems, when one blocks your path.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Reptalons don’t breathe fire, but their gaze can scorch your courage.</line>
    <line>Don’t confuse their silent fury for mercy. They burn in other ways.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="cave">
    <line>They nest in caves too small for dragons but too dangerous for mortals. I mapped many—lost more.</line>
    <line>If you see fresh scorch marks outside a cave, leave it be. A Reptalon lurks within.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="feather">
    <line>No, Reptalons have no feathers—though some deluded naturalists claim otherwise.</line>
    <line>I’d pay to see the scholar who plucked a Reptalon for study.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="tooth">
    <line>I have a necklace of Reptalon teeth—each one earned in terror and blood.</line>
    <line>Their teeth grow back faster than you can harvest them. Best not to try.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="hunt">
    <line>Many hunt Reptalons for glory. Few return with stories—fewer still with their wits intact.</line>
    <line>To hunt a Reptalon is to dance with death. I choose to study, not chase.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="scholar">
    <line>Scholar is a polite word for one obsessed. My colleagues mock me—until they need advice.</line>
    <line>The life of a scholar is lonely, but safer than that of a hero.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="library">
    <line>I lost half my library to Reptalon fire. The rest is ash in the wind.</line>
    <line>Books hold wisdom, but they burn faster than courage.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="talent">
    <line>My only talent is persistence. Reptalons have taught me resilience—and loss.</line>
    <line>Ask a Reptalon about talent, and it will show you what hunger can achieve.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="mystery">
    <line>Reptalons are wrapped in mystery—no two accounts ever agree.</line>
    <line>I’ve devoted my life to unraveling their secrets, and I know less now than when I began.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="riddle">
    <line>Some say Reptalons speak in riddles. I say they are the riddle.</line>
    <line>I asked a Reptalon a riddle once. It answered with a roar.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="night">
    <line>At night, you hear them hunting. That’s when I double-lock my doors and pray to the old gods.</line>
    <line>Some sleep through the night. I count Reptalon shadows on the wall.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="tail">
    <line>Their tails sweep the ground like scythes—once saw one fell a tree with a single blow.</line>
    <line>If a Reptalon lashes its tail, duck or die.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="jewel">
    <line>They hoard only rare jewels—never gold. The rarer, the more likely it draws their hunger.</line>
    <line>I lost a ring to a Reptalon. It swallowed it whole, then winked at me.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="curse">
    <line>Some believe Reptalons are cursed dragons. I think they’re just evolution’s cruel jest.</line>
    <line>If there is a curse, it’s on those who cross their path.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="magic">
    <line>Reptalons crave magic as much as meat. My wards never stopped them, only slowed their appetite.</line>
    <line>There’s magic in their eyes, and madness too.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="sage">
    <line>I once consulted a sage about Reptalons. He laughed—then packed his bags and left town.</line>
    <line>The wise fear what they cannot understand. Sages are seldom wise about Reptalons.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="potion">
    <line>No potion can protect you from a Reptalon’s hunger—trust me, I’ve tried them all.</line>
    <line>I brewed a potion to repel Reptalons. It only made me tastier, I think.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="fool">
    <line>A fool seeks to tame a Reptalon. A wise person watches from afar.</line>
    <line>I have been both—fool and scholar. The Reptalon taught me humility.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="weather">
    <line>They fly when the storms gather. Some say they bring the thunder; others say they chase it.</line>
    <line>If the wind changes suddenly, beware—the Reptalon may be near.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="treasure">
    <line>Reptalons ignore common gold, but a rare artifact will draw them from leagues away.</line>
    <line>I lost a priceless artifact to a Reptalon once. It ate the box, too.</line>

    <line>My occupation? I watch the boundaries between life and death. I study the Restless Souls that drift in this haunted land.</line>
    <line>Some call me a spirit-tamer, others a graveyard loiterer. I call myself a warden of peace—and, sometimes, a foe to the dead.</line>
    <line>If you're curious, ask me about Restless Souls. Most folk are too afraid.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="restless soul">
    <line>Restless Souls are echoes of the departed, torn from their peace. They haunt the dusk, muttering regrets and curses.</line>
    <line>I've spent years tracking them—each has unfinished business, and a hunger for warmth they no longer possess.</line>
    <line>What drives me? Ask about my reason. It's more personal than you think.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="reason">
    <line>My sister was taken by a Restless Soul—her laughter stolen on a moonless night. I vowed to understand their suffering, and end it when I can.</line>
    <line>I've seen their habits—how they cling to old places and relive their final moments. It’s a dreadful routine. If you want, ask me about their habits.</line>
    <line>I do not hate easily, but these souls… they leave a scar on every life they brush. Their habits reveal much, for those who watch closely.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="habit">
    <line>Restless Souls flock to graveyards, ruins, and places of sudden death. They fear daylight, and gather where sorrow lingers.</line>
    <line>Some haunt their own graves; others wander, forever lost. I can tell you where to find them, if you dare ask about haunted places.</line>
    <line>It’s said they whisper secrets to the living who cross their paths. Only the bold listen for long. If you seek them, ask me about haunted places.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="haunted place">
    <line>The old cemetery on the hill is thick with them—unmarked graves, restless memories.</line>
    <line>Abandoned chapels, ruined keeps, and crossroads at midnight—these draw the lost dead like moths to a lantern.</line>
    <line>But their suffering persists for a reason. Would you learn their weakness? Ask about that.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="weakness">
    <line>Their sorrow is both their chain and their shield. But there is a way to put them to rest—force, if mercy fails.</line>
    <line>Salt, iron, and resolve. I have none left to spare. If you have the heart, you must ‘banish’ them yourself.</line>
    <line>If you are willing, say ‘banish’ and I will entrust you with a grim task.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="banish" itemType="KillQuestScroll" ctorArgs="RestlessSoul,10,500">
    <line>Ten Restless Souls must be laid to rest before dawn’s light. Take this scroll to mark your deeds.</line>

  <entry keyword="grave">
    <line>Every grave is a story. Some stories refuse to end—those are the dangerous ones.</line>
    <line>I walk the graves by moonlight, hoping to find peace. It rarely finds me.</line>

    <line>My job? Ha! I am the desert’s sworn observer, chronicler of its most furious child: the sand vortex.</line>
    <line>Some call me a storm-watcher. Others, a fool with a death wish. But I alone understand the dance of the sand vortex.</line>
    <line>The wind speaks secrets—ask me about sand if you have the grit.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sand">
    <line>Sand is memory—every grain a history, every dune a grave. But when it moves as a vortex, it becomes fury incarnate.</line>
    <line>Sand shapes the world and buries the unwise. But none shape sand like the vortex. Ask about the vortex, if you dare hear the truth.</line>
    <line>My hatred was born in a spiral of sand. Speak the word vortex if you wish to hear of my obsession.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vortex">
    <line>A vortex is no mere dust devil—it’s a mindless hunger, a gnawing spiral that devours all it touches.</line>
    <line>I have charted their movements, their tempests. But only the sand vortex is both artist and executioner.</line>
    <line>The sand vortex took everything from me. If you crave the tale, ask me of loss.</line>

    <line>The amulet of wind’s mercy—said to protect travelers from storms. Now it lies in a sand vortex’s heart, spinning beyond reach.</line>
    <line>They say the sand vortex is drawn to what shines and glimmers. My amulet was both—a perfect lure and a perfect loss.</line>
    <line>I will never rest until the vortex is defeated. If you seek a challenge, speak of revenge.</line>

  <entry keyword="rampage">
    <line>A single ridgeback on a rampage is ruin given claws. Fields, fences, even stonework—nothing is safe.</line>
    <line>My life’s greatest work was lost to their trampling. Want to know? Ask about my mural.</line>
    <line>People fear for their livestock; I mourn for my art. The mural I painted—gone beneath their claws.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mural">
    <line>It was to be my masterpiece—a grand mural, painted on the canyon walls, inspired by the ridgebacks themselves.</line>
    <line>Vivid pigments, rare minerals, weeks of perilous labor—all for nothing. They devoured the color, scraped the rock bare.</line>
    <line>Art destroyed by its own muse. If you wish to understand the cost, ask about the pigments.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pigment">
    <line>Each pigment was gathered from wildflowers, minerals, even ridgeback scales—rare, iridescent, worth a king’s ransom.</line>
    <line>The ridgebacks were drawn by the scents and colors. My own admiration brought them down upon me.</line>

    <line>The crest of a ridgeback stands tall—warning and weapon both. To see one lowered is to see fury unleashed.</line>

    <line>Follow their tracks at your peril—they lead to danger, not treasure.</line>

    <line>A ridgeback’s fang is curved and yellowed, perfect for tearing. I use one as a paintbrush—an irony not lost on me.</line>

  </entry>
  <entry keyword="solitude">

    <line>Ask me about exile, and I’ll tell you how it feels to be hunted by shamans.</line>

    <line>Exile is their punishment for outsiders, and their test of strength. They bind you, blindfolded, and leave you for the spirits—or the wolves.</line>

    <line>What kept me alive? Only hatred—and a strange fascination. Ask about their magic, if you dare.</line>

  <entry keyword="magic">
    <line>Their magic is older than the stones. They conjure storms, summon snakes, and twist minds. I have scars from their curses.</line>

    <line>If you want to truly harm them, ask me about the staff.</line>

    <line>If you hear chanting from a cave, turn back. Nothing good waits within.</line>

    <line>My job? I observe, chronicle, and, alas, oppose the Serpentine Dragons.</line>

    <line>Serpents have always haunted our lands, but the SerpentsFang breed is different—more cunning, more cruel.</line>
    <line>I’ve learned to read the slither in the grass, the scales in the moonlight. Ask about fangs, if you’re not squeamish.</line>

    <line>My job? I’m a student—and survivor—of the sewers’ hidden kingdoms. I chart rat territories and their midnight feasts.</line>
    <line>Others call me a pest-controller, but I call myself a scholar of filth. There’s no sewer rat I haven’t met or despised.</line>
    <line>If you wish to know more about sewer rats, speak the word—though beware, it’s a subject that gnaws at me.</line>

    <line>Sewer rats are more than vermin—they’re schemers, thieves, and, oddly, connoisseurs of the finer things.</line>
    <line>Most folk see only filth. I see a cunning adversary, always one step ahead, especially in the pursuit of delicacies.</line>
    <line>I have reason to hate them—ask about delicacies, if you want to know my pain.</line>

  <entry keyword="delicacies">
    <line>I was once a rising star among cooks, you know. My recipes, my flavors—beyond compare!</line>
    <line>The sewer rats stole something irreplaceable from me. My book of secret recipes. Their greasy paws defiled every page.</line>

  <entry keyword="recipe book">
    <line>Bound in green leather, full of family secrets—and now, gnawed to scraps in some stinking burrow.</line>

  <entry keyword="revenge">
    <line>Revenge is a meal best served with rat stew. But first, the main ingredient: dead sewer rats.</line>

  <entry keyword="cat">
    <line>Cats claim to be rat hunters, but they won’t follow prey into the sewers. Too wet, too dark—they have their pride.</line>

  <entry keyword="flood">
    <line>Sewer floods drive rats into basements, bedrooms, even bakeries. The true test of a village is how it handles a wet rat.</line>
    <line>Last spring’s flood sent rats scurrying up every drain. Some say they’re still hiding in the mayor’s pantry.</line>

    <line>The tunnels beneath this town twist and turn like a rat’s tail—easy to get lost, easy to be found.</line>

    <line>The sewers are never silent. There’s always a splash, a scrape, a gnawing in the dark.</line>
    <line>If you hear silence in the sewers, worry. It means the rats are watching you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="night">
    <line>At night, the rats rule above ground too—searching for scraps, haunting dreams.</line>
    <line>I lock my windows at dusk. It’s not the wind I fear, but the night visitors with tails.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>Every rat is part of a clan—mother, father, dozens of siblings, all hungry.</line>
    <line>If you see one rat, expect a dozen cousins to follow.</line>

    <line>Find the queen, they say, and the rest will scatter. I have my doubts.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lore">
    <line>The sewers are full of secrets—old magic, buried stories, and rats who’ve seen too much.</line>
    <line>I collect lore, but it’s the rats who remember everything.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="key">
    <line>I once lost a key in the sewers. Found it weeks later—inside a rat’s nest, tied with ribbon.</line>
    <line>If you need a key, ask a rat. Just don’t expect it back.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>A cornered sewer rat is more dangerous than a starved wolf. I bear the scars to prove it.</line>
    <line>Never underestimate the bite of a desperate rat.</line>

  <entry keyword="water">
    <line>Sewer water runs cold, thick, and full of secrets—and rats.</line>

    <line>They feed, but not as living things do. A Shade’s hunger is for what cannot be replaced—light, warmth, memories.</line>

    <line>They covet memories above all else. To a Shade, a treasured memory is the finest feast.</line>
    <line>They slip behind you, brush your shadow, and steal the faces of your loved ones from your mind.</line>

    <line>I lost my wife not to death, but to forgetting. A Shade stole her shadow, and with it, my memories of her smile.</line>

    <line>There is but one path to peace for me. Ask me about vengeance.</line>

    <line>The only true key is sunlight. I wish I could carry it in my pocket.</line>

    <line>I wear a black cloak, not for fashion, but to confuse their eyes. Shadows hiding in shadows.</line>
    <line>It makes me invisible to no one but myself, sadly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="book">
    <line>I keep a journal of every encounter. When the mind forgets, the ink remembers.</line>
    <line>Ask to see my book, and you will find only blank pages. The Shades have taken even that.</line>

    <line>I nail my windows shut each night. It helps little—the darkness finds a way.</line>
    <line>Even sunlight through a window feels thin these days.</line>

    <line>Some say tossing a silver coin at a Shade will buy you safe passage. I have never found one rich enough to try it.</line>
    <line>I keep a silver coin in my pocket, for luck. It has brought me only sleepless nights.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>Music is the only thing Shades cannot touch. Perhaps because it lives in the air, not in memory.</line>
    <line>I hum old tunes in the dark. Sometimes, the silence hums back.</line>

  <entry keyword="fear">
    <line>Fear is a feast for Shades, but indifference tastes bitter to them.</line>
    <line>I have tried to be fearless. It only makes them cleverer.</line>

    <line>They nest where the earth is softest, the memories freshest.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="necromancer">
    <line>Necromancers fancy themselves artists. Their true art is suffering, painted in bone and ash.</line>
    <line>Not all necromancers are wicked, but none respect the bond between cat and companion.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fur">
    <line>No fur remains—just the ghost of softness, a memory in dust and moonlight.</line>
    <line>I still find tufts of Mittens’ fur sometimes, tucked in old blankets. It hurts anew each time.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="paw">
    <line>Their paws leave no prints, yet you’ll feel their presence like a cold wind on your neck.</line>
    <line>Skeletal paws tap out ancient codes on stone floors. What messages do they spell?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mouse">
    <line>Even in undeath, they hunt mice—but for sport, not sustenance. The poor mice never learn.</line>
    <line>A mouse will freeze at the sight of a Skeletal Cat—then scurry for its tiny life.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>Moonlight stirs them. A full moon sets their bones alight with silent energy.</line>
    <line>Some nights, I see their shadows dancing across gravestones, chasing memories.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="meow">
    <line>Their meow is a hollow rasp, like wind through broken teeth.</line>
    <line>I sometimes hear it at night—a memory or a warning, I cannot say.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Skeletal Cats slip between shadows. Sometimes, the shadows follow them.</line>
    <line>I’ve lost track of how many I’ve glimpsed from the corner of my eye, gone in a blink.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="milk">
    <line>I once set out bowls of milk for strays. Now, the milk turns sour if left out too long—an ill omen.</line>
    <line>Skeletal Cats care nothing for milk. Their hunger is of another kind.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisker">
    <line>No whiskers left—just splinters where touch met the world.</line>
    <line>Some claim a Skeletal Cat’s whisker brings luck. I call it folly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="kitten">
    <line>Kittens? I remember Mittens as a kitten, playful and bright. No Skeletal Cat was ever truly young.</line>
    <line>If you see a tiny skeleton in the moonlight—run. Some curses do not wait for age.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="yarn">
    <line>Yarn was Mittens’ favorite. Now, Skeletal Cats only tangle nightmares.</line>
    <line>I keep a ball of yarn on my desk, for memory. Sometimes it unravels by itself.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scratch">
    <line>The scratch of bone on stone is unmistakable. It sets my teeth on edge.</line>
    <line>Beware their claws. They are sharper than truth and twice as cold.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>At midnight, I hear a song—a bone-chime melody. They call to each other, and to lost loves.</line>
    <line>Once, Mittens would purr a lullaby to sleep. Now, silence sings louder.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="litter">
    <line>One Skeletal Cat leads to a litter. Their nests are lined with grave-flowers and broken dreams.</line>
    <line>I tried clearing a nest once. The bones bit back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="jewel">
    <line>Rumor says Skeletal Cats hoard small jewels in their ribcages. I wouldn’t pry one open to check.</line>
    <line>My signet ring vanished the night Mittens died. I sometimes think she keeps it still.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>Gaze into their empty eye sockets, and you’ll see your own reflection—if you’re lucky.</line>
    <line>Some say their eyes glow green in moonlight. I see only regret.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="purr">
    <line>Their purr is the sound of wind through tombstones—soothing to some, chilling to most.</line>
    <line>I long for Mittens’ true purr. The echo I hear now brings no comfort.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fish">
    <line>Even in undeath, they seem drawn to fish. Perhaps some instincts outlast the flesh.</line>
    <line>A fisherman swore he saw bones skittering away with his best catch.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ring">
    <line>I lost my ring the night Mittens became unbound. Was it fate, or theft?</line>
    <line>Legend says the dead keep what was lost. I hope she keeps it safe.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ember">
    <line>An ember from the hearth once soothed her. Now, only coldness remains where she curled.</line>
    <line>Some believe burning an ember at the door keeps them out. I am not so sure.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silence">
    <line>Silence is their herald—no creak, no pad, just an ache in the air before they appear.</line>
    <line>After Mittens changed, the house was never silent again. There was always… something.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dust">
    <line>Every corner, every ledge, dust gathers. Skeletal Cats love dust—it’s proof they’ve been and gone.</line>
    <line>Sometimes I find pawprints in the dust, long after I’ve swept.</line>
