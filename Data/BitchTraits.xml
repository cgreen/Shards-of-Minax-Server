  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>My calling? I study and catalog the most wretched abominations—Gazers.</line>
    <line>To some I am a scholar, to others a lunatic. The truth? I am the world’s foremost Gazer nemesis.</line>
    <line>Ask me about Gazers. If you value your sanity, tread carefully.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gazer">
    <line>Gazers—levitating horrors with too many eyes and even more secrets.</line>
    <line>Some call them magical marvels. I call them nightmares with tentacles.</line>
    <line>If you wish to know more, ask about their eyes. But beware what you seek.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>Each Gazer’s eye is unique—swirling, unblinking, filled with cosmic malice.</line>
    <line>They see far more than mere mortals. Their gaze pierces armor, and sometimes, the soul.</line>
    <line>Why do I despise them? The answer lies in my past. Ask about my brother.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="brother">
    <line>My brother was a mage—gifted, curious, too bold for his own good.</line>
    <line>One night, he sought to bind a Gazer. He believed knowledge could be tamed.</line>
    <line>The Gazer stole his sight, his mind, and—some say—his very essence. I have sworn vengeance. Ask me about revenge, if you dare.</line>

  <entry keyword="revenge">
    <line>Vengeance is my life’s work. The Gazer that took my brother yet haunts these lands.</line>
    <line>I have studied their haunts, their rituals, their every weakness. Still, they mock me with every blink.</line>

  <entry keyword="tentacle">
    <line>Each tentacle has a mind of its own—writhing, grasping, always searching.</line>
    <line>A tentacle’s touch burns worse than a flame. I keep scars as reminders.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blink">
    <line>Gazers never blink—not really. That’s why sleep eludes me.</line>
    <line>They say if you stare at a Gazer long enough, you forget how to close your eyes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="float">
    <line>Gazers float above the ground—no footsteps, no warning. Only a chill in the air tells you they’re near.</line>
    <line>The way they drift...like a bad thought you can’t shake.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="magic">
    <line>Gazer magic is ancient and chaotic—raw power twisted by madness.</line>
    <line>Never challenge a Gazer at a contest of spells. Their magic bites back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spell">
    <line>Their spells are mostly curses—blindness, madness, whispers you can’t unhear.</line>
    <line>One spell of theirs turned a friend into a frog. He never forgave me for laughing.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="library">
    <line>Books on Gazers are rare—many scholars go mad before finishing their research.</line>
    <line>I keep my notes under lock and key. Some knowledge hungers to be known.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>A mirror confuses a Gazer, if you believe old tales. I’ve yet to test it. Cowardice or wisdom?</line>
    <line>Once I caught a Gazer admiring itself in a pond. The world nearly ended from vanity.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fear">
    <line>They feed on fear—sometimes I wonder if my obsession only makes them stronger.</line>
    <line>I have learned to swallow fear, but it never stays down for long.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scholar">
    <line>Other scholars study butterflies or ancient coins. I study Gazers. Someone has to.</line>

  <entry keyword="sanity">
    <line>Sanity is a luxury for those who don’t stare into a Gazer’s eye. I make do with caution.</line>
    <line>Lost my grip on reality once. Found it under my pillow, next to a Gazer tooth.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cult">
    <line>There are those who worship Gazers, believing them to be gods. Madness wears many faces.</line>
    <line>The Cult of the Infinite Eye tried to recruit me once. I declined—politely, with a fireball.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>I dream of Gazers. Their eyes haunt my sleep, staring from every shadow.</line>
    <line>Sometimes I dream I am the Gazer. Those nights, I wake up screaming.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="loss">
    <line>Loss is a teacher—and a wound that never closes. My brother’s laughter still echoes, somewhere.</line>
    <line>I have lost much to Gazers. But never my resolve.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="riddle">
    <line>Gazers love riddles, but their answers lead only to madness.</line>
    <line>Ask them a question, and you’ll wish you hadn’t understood the reply.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="orb">
    <line>Some say their orbs hold stolen souls, swirling within. I don’t care to find out firsthand.</line>
    <line>A Gazer’s orb pulses with otherworldly light. Staring too long brings headaches—and visions.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hide">
    <line>I have hidden from Gazers in barrels, chimneys, even coffins. None were comfortable.</line>
    <line>Don’t try to hide from their gaze. They see more than you can imagine.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="book">
    <line>My research fills a dozen tomes, each more unsettling than the last.</line>
    <line>If you find a book bound in blue leather, leave it. Some knowledge is best forgotten.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="teeth">
    <line>Gazers have teeth—did you know? Hidden behind the eyes. That’s why I flinch at dentists.</line>
    <line>I collected a Gazer tooth once. It hummed in the moonlight. I buried it the next day.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="curse">
    <line>Their curses linger. My shadow moves on its own, some nights.</line>
    <line>Breaking a Gazer’s curse is possible. Surviving the attempt, less so.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="soup">
    <line>Once tried making Gazer-eye soup. Bad idea. The soup blinked back.</line>
    <line>If anyone offers you soup in this village, ask about the recipe first.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lantern">
    <line>A bright lantern may keep a Gazer at bay. Or maybe it just makes it easier for them to find you.</line>
    <line>I carry two lanterns at night—one for seeing, one for swinging.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trade">
    <line>I don’t trade in artifacts anymore. Last time, a Gazer followed me home.</line>
    <line>If you find Gazer relics, burn them. Don’t ask how I know.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="madness">
    <line>Madness is a Gazer’s greatest gift—and its cruelest curse.</line>
    <line>The boundary between brilliance and madness grows thin the more you study them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hat">
    <line>I wear hats with wide brims—to block unwanted gazes and falling debris.</line>
    <line>Once, a Gazer snatched my hat midair. I haven’t worn that color since.</line>

<trait name="Ghoul Scholar" priority="40">
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>My vocation? I catalog, pursue, and, when fortune favors, eradicate ghouls from these lands.</line>
    <line>Some call me a scholar, others a ghoul-hunter. But to me, I am their most fervent observer—and their sworn enemy.</line>
    <line>I know every habit, hunger, and haunt of the ghouls. If you’re curious, ask me about ghouls.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ghoul">
    <line>Ghouls are graveyard vermin—undead fiends who devour the dead and defile the earth.</line>
    <line>No creature is as wretchedly cunning or as insatiably hungry as the ghoul. Their appetite is legendary.</line>
    <line>I have studied their habits for years. Their haunts, especially, are worth asking about.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="haunt">
    <line>Ghouls lurk in forgotten graveyards and ancient crypts—anywhere shadows cling to bone and memory.</line>
    <line>Their haunts are marked by overturned earth, gnawed bones, and a stench of spoiled dreams.</line>
    <line>One haunt, in particular, changed my life—the desecrated tomb of my own kin. Ask about tomb if you wish.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tomb">
    <line>It was my family tomb, passed down for generations. The ghouls ravaged it—leaving ruin and heartbreak.</line>
    <line>I discovered the tomb defiled, every casket opened, every keepsake stolen or shattered.</line>
    <line>Their hunger for flesh is only rivaled by their greed for grave-goods. If you care to know more, ask about keepsakes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="keepsake">
    <line>Among the scattered bones, I found my mother’s locket—gnawed, ruined. It was a final insult I cannot forgive.</line>
    <line>The ghouls steal mementos, hoping to lure the living into their grasp. My quest for vengeance began with that locket.</line>
    <line>Vengeance is my only solace. If you seek justice as well, ask me about vengeance.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vengeance">
    <line>Vengeance is all I have left. I cannot rest while ghouls defile our dead and our memories.</line>
    <line>Would you help me bring justice to these carrion fiends? If you have the courage, say ‘hunt’.</line>
    <line>To cleanse the graves and reclaim peace, ten ghouls must fall. Ready yourself, and say ‘hunt’ if you accept.</line>

    <line>The graves wait for justice. Return when the ghouls are dust and the scroll is complete.</line>

  <!-- Red Herrings / Flavor Keywords (24) -->
  <entry keyword="crypt">
    <line>The air in crypts is always cold, but not as cold as a ghoul’s touch.</line>
    <line>I’ve spent more nights in crypts than I care to admit—haunted by memories and monsters alike.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flesh">
    <line>Ghouls hunger for flesh, whether old or fresh. Nothing else sates them.</line>
    <line>Few things unsettle me more than the sound of gnawing in the night.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bone">
    <line>Ghouls grind bones to powder, searching for marrow like greedy children after sweets.</line>
    <line>If you find a pile of chewed bones, beware—ghouls are near.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>They say the ghouls grow bolder under a waning moon—perhaps they draw power from the darkness.</line>
    <line>I have learned to fear the full moon, for that’s when graveyards grow restless.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fear">
    <line>To know ghouls is to know fear. They are terror made flesh—or rather, un-flesh.</line>
    <line>Fear sharpens the senses, but ghouls sense fear as keenly as blood.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="graveyard">
    <line>Graveyards were once places of peace. Now, they are feasting halls for ghouls.</line>
    <line>If you must pass through a graveyard at night, carry salt and iron. Trust me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="salt">
    <line>Salt is said to keep the dead in their graves. I line every threshold with it.</line>
    <line>I’ve sprinkled salt on bones—sometimes it works, sometimes not. The ghouls are clever.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="iron">
    <line>Iron is a ward against dark magic, so the old tales claim. My blade is always iron—for hope, if not for effect.</line>
    <line>Ghouls do not fear iron, but I feel braver when I hold it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smell">
    <line>You can smell a ghoul before you see it—like spoiled meat and wet earth.</line>
    <line>The stench of a ghoul lingers long after they’re gone.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="night">
    <line>Ghouls own the night. Daylight scatters them, but they return at dusk with renewed hunger.</line>
    <line>The bravest souls don’t linger in graveyards at night. I’ve learned that lesson well.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="family">
    <line>Ghouls are solitary, but I wonder if they remember their families—the ones they once were.</line>
    <line>I have lost family to ghouls. That pain never truly leaves you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bite">
    <line>A ghoul’s bite is poison—feverish, cold. Only the strongest survive it.</line>
    <line>I bear the scar of a ghoul’s bite. Some nights it burns, as if reminding me of their curse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="curse">
    <line>Some say ghouls are cursed souls, trapped by their hunger and hate.</line>
    <line>Curses linger where ghouls walk. I never ignore the whispers of the dead.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Ghouls cling to the shadows, hiding from torchlight and hope alike.</line>
    <line>If your torch flickers in a crypt, beware—the shadows may move.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shovel">
    <line>I keep my shovel close—not just for digging, but for fending off ghouls at close quarters.</line>
    <line>A true ghoul-hunter never trusts a shovel left standing upright.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="prayer">
    <line>I have recited every prayer I know over the graves, but still the ghouls come.</line>
    <line>Some say a strong prayer can hold ghouls at bay. I wish I still believed it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="coin">
    <line>In olden times, coins were placed on the eyes of the dead to pay for peace. The ghouls take them anyway.</line>
    <line>Every coin gone from a grave is another small theft by greedy hands or hungry monsters.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scrap">
    <line>Ghouls leave scraps of cloth and flesh behind—morbid reminders of their feasts.</line>
    <line>Every scrap I find tells a story I’d rather forget.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>Sometimes the graves whisper. Some voices are memories, some warnings. Some are hungry.</line>
    <line>I have followed whispers into darkness, and found only regret.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="claw">
    <line>The claws of a ghoul are sharper than any blade. I’ve seen them tear stone as easily as flesh.</line>
    <line>A single claw mark on a tomb is enough to warn me away for weeks.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rotting">
    <line>Rotting flesh is a ghoul’s perfume, their badge and their camouflage.</line>
    <line>The smell of rot carries far in the night air. I have learned to follow it—carefully.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chant">
    <line>Old folk chant in the night to keep the ghouls away. Sometimes, I join them, for comfort’s sake.</line>
    <line>A chant in the graveyard at midnight may draw ghouls—or drive them off. I do not take chances.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="locket">
    <line>That locket was all I had left of my mother. Now, it’s ruined—another thing the ghouls took from me.</line>
    <line>I sometimes dream of finding that locket whole. It always ends in heartbreak.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>I do not sleep easily—not since the ghouls came. Every dream is haunted.</line>
    <line>To sleep in a graveyard is to risk never waking—except as prey.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lantern">
    <line>A lantern’s light flickers, but it can keep a ghoul at bay—if only for a moment.</line>
    <line>I’ve lost more lanterns to trembling hands than to the wind.</line>

  <entry keyword="black widow">
    <line>The giant black widow is a monster made of shadow and silk—sharper than steel, deadlier than nightshade.</line>
    <line>They hide in darkness, waiting for prey... or revenge. For one in particular stole something precious from me.</line>
    <line>To truly understand my obsession, you must ask of the ring. That cursed ring changed everything.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ring">
    <line>It was my grandmother’s ring—worn since childhood, lost one foolish night in the old crypts.</line>
    <line>A glint of silver, a flash of legs, and it was gone—spirited away by a black widow into her web.</line>
    <line>I have chased rumors and webs ever since. If you care to hear more, inquire about the crypt.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="crypt">
    <line>The crypt beneath the ruined chapel is their nest now, thick with silk and bones.</line>
    <line>I ventured there once, heart pounding, torch sputtering. I barely escaped, ringless and haunted by webs.</line>

    <line>A black widow’s nest is a tangle of silk and death. Do not enter unless you wish to become a feast.</line>
    <line>I lost a friend to a nest once. We only found his boots.</line>

    <line>My occupation? I study the enigmatic Giant Ice Worms of the north—monsters both beautiful and ruinous.</line>
    <line>Some call me a worm sage, others an obsessed fool. Truthfully, I am both.</line>

    <line>Giant Ice Worms are miracles of frost—beasts that tunnel through glacier and snow, chilling the land as they go.</line>
    <line>They shimmer with cold light beneath the ice, but leave only ruin behind. If you wish to know their habits, ask about tunneling.</line>
    <line>Admire them, but never trust them. If you want to hear the tragedy of their tunnels, ask me about tunneling.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Step 3: tunneling -->
  <entry keyword="tunneling">
    <line>Tunneling is their art and their weapon. They spiral through frozen earth, undermining villages and collapsing roads.</line>
    <line>The pattern of their tunnels is like music—deadly music. But it was tunneling that destroyed my research outpost.</line>
    <line>Through their tunneling, they unearthed my sanctuary and ruined all. What they seek below is as mysterious as their cold hearts. Ask about crystals, if you seek to understand.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Step 4: crystals -->
  <entry keyword="crystals">
    <line>The worms crave the ancient frost crystals hidden deep in the glacier’s heart. Those gems are older than memory itself.</line>
    <line>Frost crystals are both their lure and their doom—feeding on their power, the worms grow vast and voracious.</line>
    <line>I once held a frost crystal, studied its beauty—until the worms sensed it and came. My work shattered. If you wish to know what I lost, ask me of my journal.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Step 5: journal -->
  <entry keyword="journal">
    <line>My journal held decades of knowledge—stolen in a single, slithering night. The ice worms dragged it into the deep, with all my notes.</line>

    <line>The ice worms make music as they tunnel—rumbling, resonant, and deeply unsettling.</line>
    <line>Some claim to hear melodies in the glacier at night. I only hear warnings.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Fire is the only defense against the worms. A torch at your side, always.</line>
    <line>They fear fire as much as I fear their cold. A rare balance.</line>

    <line>My profession? Golem-watcher, golem-hunter, golem-scholar—depends on the day and the weather.</line>
    <line>Some call me an eccentric, others a madman, but I know more of golems than any wizard alive.</line>
    <line>I devote my life to the study and downfall of those lumbering horrors. Ask me about golems, if you care for your shins.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="golem">
    <line>Golems—animated stone, bound by runes and sheer stubbornness. Monuments to hubris, if you ask me.</line>
    <line>They are wonders of magic and engineering—until they crush your front gate or stomp your pet duck.</line>
    <line>People admire their strength, but they never see the danger. If you’re curious, ask me about their creator.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="creator">
    <line>Every golem has a creator—some mage with more ambition than sense.</line>
    <line>The fool who made the first golem did so to “protect” his village. It flattened the mill within a week.</line>
    <line>I once trusted a golem’s maker. My trust cost me dearly. If you wish to know why, ask about betrayal.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="betrayal">
    <line>Betrayal stings, but betrayal by stone is a wound that never heals.</line>
    <line>The golem was meant to serve—until it turned, following warped commands. It destroyed more than my faith.</line>
    <line>I lost more than just property to that rampage. If you want the tale, ask about the locket.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="locket">
    <line>That locket held a portrait—my sister’s likeness, gone now with the ashes of our home.</line>
    <line>When the golem went berserk, it shattered our hearth and left the locket buried in rubble.</line>
    <line>I keep the broken chain as a reminder. My hatred is not blind—it is forged in loss. Ask me about vengeance, if you wish to help.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vengeance">
    <line>Vengeance is carved in stone—and I intend to see it through. Will you be my hammer?</line>
    <line>There is only one remedy for grief wrought by golems: their utter destruction. If you’re ready, say ‘smash’.</line>
    <line>I cannot forgive, but perhaps I can move on—if the golems fall. Say ‘smash’ if your heart is set.</line>

         ctorArgs="Golem,10,1000">
    <line>Take this scroll—bring me proof of ten shattered golems. The tally will be your guide, and my solace.</line>
    <line>Ten golems must fall. This scroll will bear witness. Return when their dust clouds the wind.</line>
    <line>No more talk—bring ruin to ten golems. Only then will the stone in my heart lighten.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Red herring & flavor keywords (24) -->
  <entry keyword="stone">
    <line>Stone remembers every chisel, every footfall. But it never forgives, nor forgets.</line>
    <line>They say some stones are haunted by old magic. Perhaps that's what animates golems—or dooms them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="magic">
    <line>Magic is a tool, not a toy. In the wrong hands, it builds monsters instead of wonders.</line>
    <line>Ask any mage—they’ll say their magic is safe, until the walls start walking.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rune">
    <line>Every golem is laced with runes—etched deep, pulsing with control. Remove one, and chaos follows.</line>
    <line>I once deciphered a golem's rune sequence. My beard still smolders from the experience.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dust">
    <line>Golems leave trails of dust thicker than a sandstorm. Sweep your house twice, and it still lingers.</line>
    <line>Some say golem dust makes good fertilizer. I wouldn’t risk my potatoes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="heart">
    <line>They say every golem has a heart of stone. I think it’s more like a stomach—hungry for chaos.</line>
    <line>If you find a golem’s heart, run. That means it’s looking for a new chest.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="command">
    <line>A golem obeys its master—until it doesn’t. Then it obeys only the law of gravity.</line>
    <line>Words shape stone. A slip of the tongue can end with a smashed house.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="duck">
    <line>My first golem encounter? It squashed my favorite duck. Feathers everywhere. Trauma for life.</line>
    <line>Golems and poultry don’t mix. Trust me, I know.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="strength">
    <line>Golem strength is legendary. Subtlety, less so. Never ask one to set a table or pet your dog.</line>
    <line>They say a golem can uproot a tree, or crush a cart. Both, if you’re unlucky.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rampage">
    <line>Golem rampages are the stuff of nightmares. Walls buckle, wagons splinter, and nerves unravel.</line>
    <line>If you see a golem running—don’t ask where. Just run faster.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ash">
    <line>After a golem attack, all that’s left is ash and regret. And, if you’re lucky, a lesson learned.</line>
    <line>I’ve sifted through too many ashes, looking for what cannot be replaced.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wizard">
    <line>Wizards claim mastery over golems. I say: hubris makes poor armor.</line>
    <line>Never trust a wizard who keeps rocks as pets.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pet">
    <line>I once met a child who tried to befriend a golem. The friendship ended with a broken fence.</line>
    <line>If you call a golem “pet,” it might fetch—half your barn.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="noise">
    <line>The sound of golem footsteps is impossible to mistake—like thunder trapped in a wine barrel.</line>
    <line>They say a silent golem is the worst. You won’t hear the end coming.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mud">
    <line>Some try making mud golems. They rarely last past the first rainstorm.</line>
    <line>Mud’s for gardens, not guardians.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="crack">
    <line>Crack! That’s the sound of a golem waking up—or a skull splitting. Guess which is worse?</line>
    <line>If you hear a crack behind you, pray it’s not stone moving.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chain">
    <line>I wear a broken chain to remember what was lost. Some chains bind, others remind.</line>
    <line>Even the strongest chain snaps under golem wrath. Metal is no match for magic and malice.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="library">
    <line>I spent years in libraries, learning about golems. None of those books warned about the heartbreak.</line>
    <line>Every library has a book on golems—most recommend running.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="home">
    <line>Home is where the hearth is… unless a golem flattens it. Then, home is the memory of walls.</line>
    <line>I used to have a home. Now, I have a vendetta.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fear">
    <line>It’s wise to fear a golem, but wiser to fear its creator. Intentions can be more dangerous than fists.</line>
    <line>Courage is not the absence of fear—it’s facing a golem with a rusty sword.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dustcloud">
    <line>When a golem falls, the dust cloud lasts for days. Enough to make your nose itch for a week.</line>
    <line>Some children chase the dust, hoping for gold. All they get is a cough.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>They say golems are restless under the full moon. I say they’re always restless—and always hungry.</line>
    <line>If you spot a golem by moonlight, stay quiet. It might mistake you for a statue.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="market">
    <line>Never bring a golem to the market. The stalls don’t stand a chance.</line>
    <line>One golem in the market—no more apples, no more carts, no more market.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="memory">
    <line>Memory is fragile—easily lost in dust and rubble. Mine is kept sharp by pain.</line>
    <line>Sometimes I dream of the days before stone walked the earth. I wake up longing for silence.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="regret">
    <line>I regret trusting magic more than I regret the loss. Some lessons are taught by stone, not words.</line>
    <line>Regret is a heavy burden—almost as heavy as a golem’s foot.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hammer">
    <line>I wield a hammer—not for building, but for smashing. Golems taught me that purpose.</line>
    <line>If you ever want to ruin a golem’s day, use a hammer. Preferably a very large one.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="coin">
    <line>Some folk offer a coin for every golem shattered. Me? I’d pay for the silence.</line>
    <line>You can’t bribe a golem—not with coin, not with praise. Only force will do.</line>

<trait name="GoreFiend Scholar" priority="40">
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>You wish to know my occupation? Some call me mad, others a scholar—I am foremost the bane and biographer of GoreFiends.</line>
    <line>While most run at the sight, I study their habits and horrors. Someone must, or their evil will thrive unchecked.</line>
    <line>Ask me about GoreFiends, if you crave nightmares or knowledge.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gorefiend">
    <line>The GoreFiend is no ordinary monster. It feasts on marrow and fear, leaving only ruin behind.</line>
    <line>They are cunning, powerful, and utterly relentless—predators born of hate. I know their every vile trick.</line>
    <line>I track their movements, their feeding. Ask me about their lairs, if you dare learn more.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lair">
    <line>They favor forgotten crypts, ruined temples, and the coldest reaches beneath our world.</line>
    <line>Each lair is marked by gore—bones gnawed clean, and a stench that sickens the air.</line>
    <line>It was in such a lair I lost what I treasured most. Ask me about loss, if you seek the heart of my obsession.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="loss">
    <line>Long ago, my brother vanished. I followed the bloody trail to a GoreFiend’s den—but arrived too late.</line>
    <line>All that remained was his locket, clenched in a monstrous claw. Since then, I’ve devoted my life to studying and ending them.</line>
    <line>My grief turned to purpose. Now I hunt them, in mind and body. If vengeance interests you, ask about retribution.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="retribution">
    <line>Retribution is more than blood—it is balance restored, a debt collected from the fiend that shattered my family.</line>
    <line>I have set traps, mapped their haunts, and gathered every weakness. But one cannot defeat a GoreFiend alone.</line>
    <line>If you possess courage and steel, ask me how you might become my avenger.</line>

    <line>I keep a collection of gnawed bones for study, not for trophies.</line>

  <entry keyword="crypt">
    <line>The crypts reek of death, but only some are cursed by GoreFiends. Tread lightly.</line>
    <line>Not all crypts hide monsters, but those that do... you never forget the chill.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="marrow">
    <line>They crave marrow above all, believing it grants them stolen strength.</line>
    <line>Only the bravest touch the bones a GoreFiend has tasted. The residue lingers.</line>

    <line>I wear a cloak of dark wool, but it is no protection from their hunger.</line>
    <line>Some think a cloak will shield them from evil. I know better.</line>

    <line>Nightmares are but shadows of a GoreFiend’s reality.</line>
    <line>My sleep is haunted by crimson eyes and gnashing teeth.</line>

  <entry keyword="brother">
    <line>My brother was brave—and a bit foolish. He thought himself invincible. He was wrong.</line>
    <line>Memories of my brother drive my every step, every study, every hunt.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="locket">
    <line>The locket is all I recovered from that cursed den. I wear it always.</line>
    <line>It once held a portrait. Now, only grief and resolve remain.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>GoreFiends are drawn to blood—fresh or old, it makes no difference.</line>
    <line>Never enter their domain with an open wound. You’ll never leave.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weakness">
    <line>Legends speak of weaknesses, but nothing is certain except their hunger.</line>
    <line>Silver, fire, prayers—some say all work. I rely on cunning and steel.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fear">
    <line>They feed on fear as much as flesh. Stand strong, or they’ll sense your terror.</line>
    <line>My fear became my teacher—and my weapon.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="torch">
    <line>A torch is essential. The darkness hides many horrors, GoreFiends among them.</line>
    <line>Some believe fire drives them back. Sometimes it only reveals them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>I bear many scars, but none so deep as the one in my heart.</line>
    <line>Each scar tells a story—a lesson in survival, a memory of pain.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="book">
    <line>I have written volumes on GoreFiends. Few dare read them, fewer still believe.</line>
    <line>The ink is nearly as red as their deeds.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silver">
    <line>Some claim silver wounds them, but I’ve seen GoreFiends laugh at such tales.</line>
    <line>I keep a silver dagger at my belt—more for hope than faith.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>The full moon drives them to madness, or so it’s said. I find no pattern, only hunger.</line>
    <line>Many fear the moon. I fear the silence that follows it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scream">
    <line>Their victims rarely have time to scream, but the echoes linger in the ruins.</line>
    <line>If you hear a scream near a lair, you are already too late.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ruin">
    <line>Wherever they dwell, ruin follows. Crops fail, wells sour, and hope flees.</line>
    <line>Some ruins predate the GoreFiends—but they always claim the darkest ones.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trophy">
    <line>I do not keep trophies—only reminders, and knowledge hard-won.</line>
    <line>A GoreFiend needs no trophy. Its pleasure is in destruction itself.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="claw">
    <line>Their claws slice through mail and bone. Beware their reach.</line>
    <line>I have measured their claws—each larger than a wolf’s, sharper than any blade.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>They say a GoreFiend’s cry is a song of death. I have heard it once, and once was enough.</line>
    <line>No bard sings of GoreFiends. Theirs is a silence of terror.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grave">
    <line>Many GoreFiends rise from ancient graves, but not all graves breed monsters.</line>
    <line>I avoid graveyards, even in daylight. Old habits, learned the hard way.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="veil">
    <line>Some say a veil separates our world from theirs. I say it is thinner than we think.</line>
    <line>A GoreFiend steps through the veil when hunger calls. Pray it never calls near you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shroud">
    <line>They leave shrouds of darkness and dread wherever they roam.</line>
    <line>Not even a burial shroud can hide a GoreFiend’s deeds.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ashes">
    <line>Burning the remains brings peace—or so I hope. The ashes are all that’s left of my courage some days.</line>
    <line>After the hunt, only ashes remain. It is both an ending and a beginning.</line>

<trait name="Gorilla Scholar" priority="40">

    <line>My occupation? Some call me a scholar, others an obsessive lunatic. I study gorillas—their habits, their mysteries, and, alas, their crimes against me.</line>
    <line>Gorillas: the subject of my research and the bane of my existence. Ask me about gorillas if you care to hear a tale of genius and betrayal.</line>

    <line>People think gorillas are noble—try telling that to someone whose hat they’ve stolen.</line>
    <line>The gorilla is a creature of mystery and mayhem. If you want nightmares, ask me about bananas.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="banana">
    <line>Bananas: a gorilla’s one true love. Unfortunately, they once mistook my priceless research notes for bananas.</line>
    <line>I can’t eat bananas anymore—too many painful memories. Ask about the notes if you dare.</line>
    <line>They’ll do anything for a banana. Especially destroy a lifetime’s work. My notes are proof.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="notes">
    <line>Years of observations, gone in one gorilla rampage. My notes were reduced to a pulp—literally.</line>
    <line>They shredded every page, then danced in the ruins. My heart broke. Only one thing survived: the map.</line>
    <line>I should have hidden the map better. If you want to know what they were after, ask about the map.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="map">
    <line>The map led to the Grove of Giants—where the largest, most cunning gorillas dwell.</line>
    <line>I believe they sensed its importance. The leader, a brute I call Old Grin, made off with it.</line>
    <line>Want to know about Old Grin, the gorilla king? Just ask. But steel your nerves.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="old grin">
    <line>Old Grin is no ordinary gorilla—smarter, meaner, and far too fond of tormenting me.</line>
    <line>He’s the one who started it all. If only someone would put an end to his mischief…</line>
    <line>If you wish to help, say the word ‘hunt’. Justice—and peace—require it.</line>

  <entry keyword="hat">
    <line>A gorilla once stole my hat—wore it for a week, then threw it in the river. Mockery is their art.</line>
    <line>Never wear a fancy hat near gorillas. They respect only baldness, I think.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="muscle">
    <line>Gorillas are all muscle—like boulders covered in fur. Don’t arm-wrestle them. Trust me.</line>
    <line>I once saw a gorilla bend an iron bar. Then use it as a back-scratcher.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="fur">
    <line>Their fur is surprisingly soft. Until it’s covered in half-chewed fruit.</line>
    <line>Collectors pay handsomely for gorilla fur, but harvesting it is a fatal hobby.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="fruit">
    <line>Gorillas love fruit, but their manners are atrocious. Juice everywhere.</line>
    <line>I’ve learned never to picnic in the jungle. Gorillas will crash any feast.</line>

  <entry keyword="jungle">
    <line>The jungle is their kingdom. No map survives long there—nor do hats.</line>
    <line>I got lost in the jungle once, guided only by the sound of banana peels squishing underfoot.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="laugh">
    <line>A gorilla’s laugh is deep and booming. You never want to be the punchline.</line>
    <line>They laugh most after they’ve outsmarted you. It’s humiliating.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="tree">
    <line>Trees are gorilla highways. They climb like shadows—if shadows weighed 400 pounds.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen them leap from tree to tree. Gravity is merely a suggestion to a gorilla.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="scratch">
    <line>Gorillas scratch when they’re bored. Or thinking. Or plotting.</line>
    <line>If you see a gorilla scratching its head, run. It’s about to get clever.</line>

  <entry keyword="thumb">
    <line>Gorillas have impressive thumbs. They use them for mischief and picking locks. Yes, really.</line>
    <line>Once saw a gorilla open a chest. Smarter than some adventurers I know.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="family">
    <line>A gorilla troop is a tight-knit family—until bananas are scarce.</line>
    <line>Old Grin’s troop is the worst—loyal to the end, and just as troublesome.</line>

    <line>Gorillas have favorite trees—don’t stand between them and their snack.</line>

  </entry>
  <entry keyword="berries">
    <line>Gorillas adore berries, but beware—so do jungle wasps. It rarely ends well.</line>

  <!-- Step 1: Job -->
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>My vocation? I study, document, and, when forced, hunt the grey wolves that haunt these wilds.</line>
    <line>Some call me a naturalist, others a madman. Both are true. Wolves are my life's obsession—my pride, my torment.</line>

    <line>Grey wolves are noble—cunning, strong, endlessly misunderstood. Yet they are also thieves and killers, by necessity and by nature.</line>

    <line>There’s an old tale: catch a hind, win a wish. I’d wish for a fence that works.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wish">
    <line>If I had one wish, it’d be for hinds to crave weeds, not moonbloom.</line>
    <line>Careful what you wish for—especially around hinds.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="twig">
    <line>Step on a twig in the woods and the hinds vanish—taking your hope with them.</line>
    <line>Twigs snap beneath their hooves, then silence. Eerie, really.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trail">
    <line>Follow a hind’s trail, and you’ll find disappointment. And chewed petals.</line>
    <line>Their trails are faint, but the damage they cause is not.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="petal">
    <line>I once tried to protect my petals with netting. The hinds just ate the net.</line>
    <line>Moonbloom petals are their favorite—mine too, when I get any.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fever">
    <line>Moonbloom tea cures fevers. If I could ever harvest enough petals...</line>
    <line>Each fevered villager is another reason to hate those hinds.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gate">
    <line>I reinforce my garden gate every spring. By summer, the hinds have found a new way in.</line>
    <line>The only thing that keeps hinds out is bad weather. And not always then.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fence">
    <line>I’ve built every kind of fence. Hinds leap, squeeze, or simply wait for me to give up.</line>
    <line>Some say a stone fence works. My hinds laugh at stone.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bloom">
    <line>Each spring, I hope for a perfect bloom. Each summer, the hinds dash those hopes.</line>
    <line>Once, I saw a moonbloom untouched. A rare miracle—or a hungry hind nearby.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="seed">
    <line>Hinds dig for seeds. Not content to eat only flowers, they hunt the next generation.</line>
    <line>I plant twice as many seeds now. Still, I never win.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hoofprint">
    <line>Hoofprints in soft earth—proof of their nightly raids.</line>
    <line>I track hoofprints, but the hinds always double back. Cunning things.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tears">
    <line>I’ve shed more tears for lost flowers than I care to admit. Hinds have no sympathy.</line>
    <line>There’s no crying in gardening, except after a hind visit.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="night">
    <line>Night is when the hinds come. Silent, sly, unstoppable.</line>
    <line>If you hear nothing in the garden at night, worry. It means the hinds have already been.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pride">
    <line>My pride and joy—gone to the jaws of a single hungry hind.</line>
    <line>Pride comes before a hind’s dinner, or so it seems.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grace">
    <line>Graceful? Certainly. Forgivable? Never.</line>
    <line>Some admire their grace—I only see a four-legged menace.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trample">
    <line>It’s not just what they eat. It’s what they trample, thoughtlessly, as they gorge.</line>
    <line>A whole year’s work flattened in a night. Hinds care for nothing but their hunger.</line>

  <entry keyword="obsession">
    <line>It began with admiration—watching Hiryus soar, their feathers glistening like living jewels.</line>

    <line>Falconer’s Folly: a day carved into my soul. My champion falcon, Arashi, struck down by a jealous Hiryu.</line>

  <entry keyword="revenant">
    <line>Some say Impalers are revenants, born of vengeance and sorrow. Perhaps that’s why I understand them so well.</line>

    <line>My work? I am a dryad scholar—obsessed, perhaps, but not blind to their madness.</line>
    <line>I study the wild dryads: their beauty, their cruelty, their descent into lunacy.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dryad">
    <line>Dryads—once, they were guardians of the glades, all song and sunlight.</line>
    <line>Now? Some grow twisted, the InsaneDryads. Their laughter chills the bones of the oldest oaks.</line>
    <line>I've witnessed their madness firsthand. Curious? Ask me about insanity.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="insanity">
    <line>Their insanity is a sickness, creeping like ivy. It warps their minds, drives them to fury.</line>
    <line>Some blame tainted sap. Others, curses from unkind gods. I blame the grove—ask about the grove, if you dare.</line>
    <line>Their insanity is not mere madness. It is a hunger, a longing for what once was. The grove holds their secrets.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grove">
    <line>The grove is sacred and profane—a heart once pure, now rotten at its roots.</line>
    <line>They say a great sorrow befell the grove. Now it breeds only rage. Ask me about sorrow, and I’ll tell you more.</line>
    <line>I have walked the grove’s edge. Heard the dryads weep. Their sorrow is poison in the soil.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sorrow">
    <line>The sorrow began with a theft—a relic stolen from the grove, leaving only grief behind.</line>
    <line>I know the relic: the Heartwood Lyre. Its absence drives the dryads wild. Speak to me of the lyre, and the truth is yours.</line>
    <line>Every mad dryad mourns the lyre. The song is broken, their sanity with it.</line>

    <line>The Heartwood Lyre soothed the groves, binding dryad and forest together.</line>

    <line>You want to know what I do? I observe, catalog, and—occasionally—flee from the Interred Grizzle.</line>
    <line>Some call me a lunatic, others a scholar. The truth? I am the world’s foremost InterredGrizzle enthusiast and adversary.</line>
    <line>I’ve spent decades charting every grisly habit of that abominable beast. Ask me about InterredGrizzle, if your nerves allow.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="InterredGrizzle">
    <line>Ah, the Interred Grizzle: crypt-borne terror, tomb’s mistake, and my greatest fascination.</line>
    <line>Few have seen its bone-white claws and lived to sketch them. Fewer still wish to remember.</line>
    <line>You wish to know more? Ask me about its lair. Only then does its horror make sense.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="lair">
    <line>The lair—dark, fetid, echoing with gnawing and regret. Beneath the old mausoleum, where the sun never remembers to shine.</line>
    <line>It’s a catacomb of misery. Bones line the walls; secrets lurk in every shadow.</line>
    <line>But a lair is nothing without its feeding. Ask what it eats—if your stomach is sturdy.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="feeding">
    <line>Feeding is a ritual. InterredGrizzle devours marrow and memory alike, feasting on the bones of heroes and the hopes of grave-robbers.</line>
    <line>Once, I watched it gnaw a coffin like a dog with a bone—except the bone was singing.</line>
    <line>But its hunger is born from loss. Ask about its sorrow, if you can bear it.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="sorrow">
    <line>Sorrow is the monster’s shadow. They say InterredGrizzle was once human, a guardian who failed his charge and was cursed to hunger eternally.</line>
    <line>Its cries are the echoes of ancient regrets. Sometimes, in the stillness, you can hear it weeping.</line>
    <line>But my hatred is personal. Ask me why I despise it above all others.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="despise">
    <line>Why do I despise the InterredGrizzle? Because it devoured the only friend I ever had—a grave-digger named Thomlin, who brought me stories and stale bread.</line>
    <line>I vowed revenge the night I found Thomlin’s hat, gnawed and bloodied, beside the mausoleum door.</line>

  <entry keyword="crypt">
    <line>Crypts are silent libraries of tragedy. Some monsters read them with their teeth.</line>
    <line>I mapped every crypt beneath this town, searching for answers. Found only more questions.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="howl">
    <line>At midnight, the InterredGrizzle howls. Not for the living, but for the peace it cannot find.</line>
    <line>I would rather hear a banshee than that mournful howl.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="key">
    <line>The only key I ever found in a crypt was made of bone. It didn’t unlock any doors—just nightmares.</line>
    <line>Keys and secrets go hand in hand, until a monster chews them both.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="cloak">
    <line>I wore a black cloak once. The beast shredded it, and nearly me with it.</line>
    <line>Now I wear only daylight and hope.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="bread">
    <line>Thomlin swore grave-digging made bread taste sweeter. I think it just made him hungrier.</line>
    <line>I still carry a crust, in memory. Rats don’t touch it. Even they know grief.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="door">
    <line>Some doors should never be opened. Others open themselves at the worst time.</line>
    <line>The InterredGrizzle is a master of doors. Locked, barred, blessed—none matter.</line>

  <entry keyword="weeping">
    <line>Weeping in the crypts means you’re still alive—or you wish you weren’t.</line>
    <line>The InterredGrizzle weeps for what it cannot remember.</line>

  <entry keyword="peace">
    <line>Peace is what I seek. Not for me, but for those the beast torments.</line>
    <line>Some say peace is the absence of monsters. I say it’s the presence of friends.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="token">
    <line>Bring a token of victory, not a trophy. The beast deserves respect, even in death.</line>
    <line>A true token is a story, not a bone.</line>

  <entry keyword="rest">
    <line>Thomlin deserves to rest. So do I. So does the InterredGrizzle, if truth be told.</line>
    <line>Rest is for the untroubled. I envy them.</line>

  <entry keyword="dawn">
    <line>Dawn is the only thing that frightens the beast. Sunlight tastes of forgiveness, or so I’m told.</line>

    <line>Sometimes I stare at the sky for hours, hoping for a sign. Sometimes I just get rained on.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="cloud">
    <line>Clouds are the KazeKemono’s playground. I swear I saw one shaped like a lion last week.</line>
    <line>Some say clouds are just water vapor. I say they’re stories waiting to be read.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>The wind speaks many tongues—whisper, shriek, sigh. Only the KazeKemono understand them all.</line>
    <line>Once, I tried to catch the wind in a jar. The jar broke, and I learned humility.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="lightning">
    <line>Lightning is the KazeKemono’s laughter, wild and sharp. I’ve seen it dance on mountaintops.</line>
    <line>Don’t trust a beast with a mane of static. They shock more than just your hair.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="gust">
    <line>Gusts are their messengers—swift, unseen, and always upending my notes.</line>
    <line>I once lost a hat to a sudden gust. I suspect the KazeKemono keep it still.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="whirlwind">
    <line>Whirlwinds sometimes follow me home. I never invite them in, but they come anyway.</line>
    <line>Spin too long in a whirlwind’s heart, and you’ll forget which way is up.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="feather">
    <line>Wind-beasts don’t have feathers—only manes that shimmer like rain on silk.</line>
    <line>Still, I’ve found feathers in the sky after a storm. Strange, isn’t it?</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="mane">
    <line>A KazeKemono’s mane is said to hold a hundred secrets. I’ve yet to learn even one.</line>
    <line>Try to pluck a mane from a wind beast and you’ll find your hands empty—or full of static.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="howl">
    <line>Their howls echo for miles, rattling windows and spooking horses.</line>
    <line>If you hear a howl and the air feels heavy—take cover. The storm is near.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="harp">
    <line>My Sky Harp is lost, its melody scattered. Sometimes the breeze brings it back, just for a moment.</line>
    <line>Strings of silver, frame of willow—my masterpiece, now only memory.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="mountain">
    <line>Mountains are the wind’s backbone, the KazeKemono’s stage. I’ve camped on their peaks, listening.</line>
    <line>I left offerings for the wind on the highest crags. The beasts took them—and left teeth marks.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="shard">
    <line>Once I found a sky-blue shard after a storm. Too cold to touch, and gone by morning.</line>
    <line>Some shards sing in the wind. Most just cut your fingers.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>Not all echoes are your own. Some belong to things with sharper teeth than memory.</line>
    <line>I heard an echo once that never ended. Still waiting for it to come back around.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="tail">
    <line>They say a KazeKemono’s tail can stir up a cyclone. I keep my distance, just in case.</line>
    <line>The only thing wilder than a wind-beast’s mane is its tail.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="fang">
    <line>Their fangs are mist and lightning—deadly, but fleeting. Don’t try to collect them.</line>
    <line>Once, I saw a fang print in a fallen tree, charred and still smoking.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="mist">
    <line>Some wind-beasts dissolve into mist when threatened. I wish my experiments could do the same.</line>
    <line>Walking in the mist, you sometimes see shapes—some best left unseen.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="season">
    <line>Spring brings tempests, and the KazeKemono with them. My roof barely survives.</line>
    <line>Every season has its wind, and every wind its beast. It’s a busy calendar.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="silence">
    <line>Silence before a storm is the KazeKemono’s favorite prank. Don’t trust the quiet.</line>
    <line>I crave silence, but the wind is never truly still—not while they roam.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="rain">
    <line>Rain follows in their wake, drenching everything I own. Paperwork included.</line>
    <line>Some say the beasts weep rain. I say they’re just sloppy eaters.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="track">
    <line>Tracking wind-beasts is hard—they leave no prints, only swirling grass and startled birds.</line>
    <line>I keep a logbook, but the pages turn themselves on windy days.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>Never look a wind-beast in the eye. Their gaze is as cold as high-altitude air.</line>
    <line>The eye of the storm is safest, they say. I say: define safe.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="beacon">
    <line>I tried to lure them with a beacon of light. All I caught was a very angry goose.</line>
    <line>Sky beacons attract more than KazeKemono—sometimes, unwanted visitors arrive.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="banner">
    <line>I once raised a banner to track the wind’s direction. The KazeKemono shredded it in an hour.</line>
    <line>Banners flutter, but wind-beasts fly. There’s a lesson there, somewhere.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="compass">
    <line>My compass spins wildly whenever a KazeKemono is near. Useless for navigation, perfect for warning.</line>
    <line>Wind and compass are old enemies. I side with the wind, usually.</line>

  <!-- Step 1: The Hook -->
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>My job? Ha! I am the city’s foremost Kepetch expert—an honor and a curse.</line>
    <line>I study, document, and—regrettably—hunt Kepetch wherever they scuttle.</line>
    <line>Kepetch are the bane of my existence and the center of my research. Ask about Kepetch if you must.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <!-- Step 2: The Obsession -->
  <entry keyword="kepetch">
    <line>Kepetch: skittering nightmares, six-legged thieves, architects of chaos beneath our feet.</line>
    <line>Some fear spiders or snakes. I have studied Kepetch for decades and found only new reasons to despise them.</line>
    <line>I would have made peace—if not for what they stole from me. Ask what they took, if you wish to know true bitterness.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <!-- Step 3: The Motive -->
  <entry keyword="stole">
    <line>They stole my father’s map, the one he charted through the ancient tunnels. Priceless, irreplaceable.</line>
    <line>While I catalogued their nest, a bold Kepetch slipped from the shadows, snatched the map, and vanished below.</line>
    <line>All my life’s work—lost to those greedy pincers. If you care, ask about the tunnels.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <!-- Step 4: The Lair -->
  <entry keyword="tunnels">
    <line>The old tunnels sprawl beneath the city—a labyrinth where Kepetch rule unchallenged.</line>
    <line>They dig, expand, and weave their empire in darkness. No lantern can keep them at bay for long.</line>
    <line>I dare not descend alone. Only the brave survive below. If you’re bold, ask about their lair.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <!-- Step 5: The Challenge -->
  <entry keyword="lair">
    <line>The lair is a nest of horror—chittering walls, crawling shadows, the constant scrape of pincers on stone.</line>
    <line>Few return with their minds intact, and fewer with their limbs. But my revenge waits in the heart of that lair.</line>
    <line>If vengeance tempts you, ask me how you might help rid us of Kepetch.</line>

    <line>I was once a respected scholar, now they call me obsessed—just because my nightmares crawl on six legs.</line>
    <line>The study of Kepetch is thankless, dangerous, and utterly necessary.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="map">
    <line>The map was my father’s legacy—every twist of the tunnels drawn by hand.</line>
    <line>I sometimes dream I’ll find the map, but it’s surely shredded in some nest.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="father">
    <line>My father vanished in the tunnels, chasing knowledge and shadowy shapes.</line>
    <line>I followed in his footsteps—now I fear I’ll share his fate.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Kepetch love the shadows. If you see one move without a source, beware.</line>
    <line>Shadows flicker where Kepetch gather. Their eyes reflect candlelight like polished stones.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="egg">

    <line>Destroying an egg cluster brings bad luck—or so the miners say.</line>

    <line>The scuttling of many legs on stone is the sound of my nightmares.</line>
    <line>When you hear scuttling, it’s already too late.</line>

    <line>Each nest is a palace of refuse—bones, cloth, stolen silver, and always, always more Kepetch.</line>
    <line>I once counted seven nests in a single vault. Still have the scars.</line>

  <entry keyword="silk">
    <line>Kepetch silk is strong as steel and twice as sticky. Some fools try to harvest it.</line>

    <line>Kepetch venom is mild, but their bites itch for weeks.</line>
    <line>Rub a Kepetch bite with garlic, or you’ll regret it come morning.</line>

    <line>Kepetch are drawn to magical artifacts—no one knows why.</line>

  <entry keyword="burrow">
    <line>Kepetch burrows twist and turn. No map stays accurate for long.</line>
    <line>The deeper the burrow, the larger the Kepetch. Or so they say.</line>

  <entry keyword="feast">
    <line>A Kepetch feast is a grisly sight—bones picked clean in minutes.</line>
    <line>I have seen them feast on a fallen rat twice their size.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="shell">
    <line>Kepetch shells are mottled, tough, and nearly impossible to crush.</line>
    <line>Some jewelers pay well for intact shells, though I can’t imagine why.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>The tunnels whisper at night. Some say it’s the wind, others say Kepetch claws.</line>
    <line>When the Kepetch whisper, you’d best hold your breath and pray.</line>

  <entry keyword="alchemist">
    <line>Alchemists buy Kepetch parts for dubious potions. I call it madness.</line>
    <line>Once, an alchemist tried to pay me in ‘Kepetch Tonic.’ I still itch thinking about it.</line>

  <entry keyword="music">

    <line>Khaldun Revenants—restless, hollow, yet too aware. I both loathe and envy them.</line>

    <line>The curse that binds them... If you care for tales of curses, ask about it.</line>

  <entry keyword="revenge">
    <line>Some say revenge is hollow. I say it’s the only thing more relentless than a revenant’s hatred.</line>

    <line>I mistook a shade for a friend once. The memory still chills me.</line>

    <line>Wizards hoard phylacteries for immortality. The Revenants have no such luxury.</line>

    <line>Khaldun once held a library of forbidden tomes. The Revenants keep no books, only memories.</line>

    <line>I keep a dagger blessed by three priests. It trembles in Khaldun, as if eager to flee.</line>
    <line>A Revenant’s touch rusts steel. Even blessed daggers corrode in their presence.</line>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>A mirror will not show you a Revenant. It will only crack and weep.</line>
    <line>Once, I glimpsed my brother in a broken mirror. I pray it was only a trick of the light.</line>

    <line>I wear an amulet of ash and bone, for all the good it does. The Revenants laugh at charms.</line>
    <line>Amulets lose their power at the threshold of Khaldun. Wear hope, not trinkets.</line>

    <line>There’s a song the Revenants hum, low and tuneless. If you hear it, cover your ears and pray.</line>
    <line>My brother was a singer once. Now, I fear he hums that same hollow tune.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wine">
    <line>I drank wine to forget the Revenants. It never worked; nightmares are immune to spirits.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tome">
    <line>I still dream of my lost tome. In my dreams, the Kirin reads it aloud, laughing at my folly.</line>

    <line>A single Kirin hoofprint is worth a fortune to certain collectors.</line>
    <line>I preserve them in wax—my only trophies.</line>

    <line>The wind speaks their name, or so I sometimes believe.</line>

  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>My profession? I am the world’s foremost scholar—and nemesis—of the dreaded Kraken.</line>
    <line>Some call me a sea-myth chaser. I call myself a survivor with a vendetta. Ask about Krakens if you have the spine.</line>
    <line>I catalog every Kraken’s attack and appetite. The ocean is their kingdom, but my mind is their prison. Ask me of the Kraken.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="kraken">
    <line>The Kraken—legend made flesh, with arms long enough to pull down hope itself.</line>
    <line>Most fear storms, I fear tentacles rising from the deep. The Kraken is nature’s nightmare.</line>
    <line>To truly loathe something, you must first appreciate its cunning. Ask about tentacles or perhaps their appetite.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tentacle">
    <line>Each Kraken has eight tentacles—each with a mind of its own. They write their own cruel stories in the salt and spray.</line>
    <line>Their grip can crush a ship or cradle a sailor—before dragging both to the abyss.</line>
    <line>But their hunger is worse than their strength. Ask me what they crave, if you dare.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="appetite">
    <line>No beast hungers as the Kraken does. They devour whales, wood, and the dreams of sailors.</line>
    <line>I watched a Kraken feast upon a merchant ship. It was not hunger, but vengeance.</line>
    <line>What fuels their fury? Some say it is treasure. Others know better. Ask me of pearls, if you wish to know my sorrow.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pearl">
    <line>Pearls—priceless to us, irresistible to Krakens. Their eyes burn for the luster of the sea’s heart.</line>
    <line>I once gathered pearls with my family. The Kraken gathered us instead. My grief is a shell with nothing inside.</line>
    <line>There is a place, the Pearl Grave, where no one returns. Ask me of the Grave, if you crave darkness.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grave">
    <line>The Pearl Grave—a sunken cove, a banquet hall for Krakens. My kin rest there, and my revenge is all that brings me sleep.</line>
    <line>None who’ve faced the Kraken at the Pearl Grave have returned whole—save me, and I am not whole.</line>
    <line>If your courage matches your curiosity, say ‘hunt’. I have a scroll that will bind your fate to the Kraken’s doom.</line>

    <line>People mistake squid for young Krakens. They’re only appetizers for the true beast.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="octopus">
    <line>Octopuses are clever, but harmless. Krakens are malice incarnate, writ large and slimy.</line>
    <line>An octopus once tried to escape my net. A Kraken tried to drown my ship. The difference is scale—and terror.</line>

    <line>I lost my ship to a Kraken once. Wood and canvas stand no chance against hatred with arms.</line>
    <line>Ships are prey to Krakens, like moths to candlelight.</line>

    <line>Some call Krakens legend. I call them scars upon the world’s memory.</line>
    <line>Legends live only because no one survives to disprove them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fisherman">
    <line>Fishermen tell tales to scare their children. The Kraken tells tales in broken boats and lost nets.</line>

    <line>I threw a net at a Kraken once. It laughed. I heard it.</line>

    <line>The deeper the sea, the darker its nightmares. The Kraken is lord of the depths.</line>
    <line>I dream of falling into those depths, and never surfacing.</line>

    <line>“The sea takes what it wants,” they say. Even a sailor’s beard. But the Kraken takes more.</line>
    <line>My beard went white the night I met the Kraken’s gaze.</line>

    <line>The sea is silent when a Kraken attacks. It’s the silence, not the screams, that haunt me.</line>
    <line>I have heard a Kraken scream. I wish I could forget the sound.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scale">
    <line>Krakens have no scales—just hide thick as ship’s planking.</line>
    <line>A single scrap of Kraken flesh would make a fortune—if you could live to sell it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>Some say the Kraken rises when the moon is full. Some say it never sleeps.</line>
    <line>The moonlit sea is beautiful, unless you know what lurks beneath.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>The sea sings, but sometimes it wails. Those are the nights when Krakens hunt.</line>
    <line>Some sing to the sea for luck. I pray for silence.</line>

    <line>The Lady of the Snow—spirit, specter, sovereign of all things cold and cruel.</line>

  <entry keyword="cruelty">
    <line>Her cruelty is not of anger, but of cold indifference—she freezes hearts and memories alike.</line>
    <line>I watched her turn a thriving village into a mausoleum of frost, including my own kin.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="family">
    <line>My family sought shelter from the storm. The Lady offered only silence and snow.</line>
    <line>Her laughter echoed through the drifts as she claimed my kin. Only I survived, left with nothing but ice and rage.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="avenge">
    <line>Vengeance is a lonely fire, but I tend it well. To defeat her is to face the cold itself.</line>
    <line>I have studied her weaknesses, but few believe me. If you have the heart, ask how one might slay the Lady of the Snow.</line>
    <line>I have a plan, but it demands courage and steel. If you wish to accept it, say the word—‘slay’.</line>

    <line>My work? I chronicle the monstrous and magnificent. Chief among them: the dreaded Leviathan.</line>
    <line>I am called many things—mariner, scribe, madman. But all my tales begin and end with Leviathan.</line>
    <line>Few dare seek knowledge of sea titans. Fewer survive. Ask me of Leviathan, if your courage holds.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="leviathan">
    <line>Leviathan—a beast the size of nightmares, all teeth and ancient rage. I both admire and despise it.</line>
    <line>No creature holds dominion over the sea like the Leviathan. Ask about the sea, and I’ll share what horrors I’ve seen.</line>
    <line>To speak the word ‘Leviathan’ is to tempt fate. My every waking thought is haunted by its shape. The sea knows why.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sea">
    <line>The sea is both cradle and grave. It hides treasures and monsters in equal measure—especially Leviathan.</line>
    <line>Many fear storms, but I fear what swims beneath. Artifacts lost, lives ruined. Ask me about the artifact I lost to it.</line>
    <line>I sailed the world’s waters, but only one place made me weep—the trench where Leviathan stole my life’s work. That artifact...</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="artifact">
    <line>The artifact was priceless—a star-metal compass, said to find any path home. Leviathan swallowed it whole.</line>
    <line>I watched in horror as that beast’s maw closed around my greatest discovery. My hope sank with it. Ask about my loss, if you care.</line>
    <line>Artifacts come and go, but some losses gnaw deeper than teeth. My loss drove me to the edge. That loss... it cannot be forgiven.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="loss">
    <line>Loss leaves a scar deeper than any wound. I lost more than an artifact—I lost friends, pride, and purpose to that monster.</line>
    <line>Have you ever felt your soul drown? That day, the Leviathan dragged mine beneath the waves. Only vengeance remains.</line>
    <line>I have one purpose now. Vengeance. Ask me how I’ll claim it, if you dare to aid me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vengeance">
    <line>Vengeance is salt in my veins and thunder in my heart. Will you help me? Say ‘hunt’ and I’ll share my plan.</line>
    <line>I plotted, I prepared, I failed alone. But together, we can slay the beast. If you’re bold, say ‘hunt’.</line>
    <line>My revenge can only be claimed in Leviathan’s blood. If you seek glory, or justice, say ‘hunt’ and I’ll arm you.</line>

         ctorArgs="Leviathan,1,10000">
    <line>Hunt the Leviathan. Bring proof of your deed, and you’ll have my gratitude—and perhaps my secrets.</line>
    <line>No mere sailor returns from Leviathan’s lair unchanged. This scroll will mark your quarry—return when it is done.</line>
    <line>Take this, and let the deep tremble. Slay the Leviathan, and my story might finally know peace.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Red herrings and flavor entries -->
  <entry keyword="whale">
    <line>Whales are gentle titans, poets of the sea. Leviathan is something altogether fouler.</line>
    <line>If you mistake a whale for Leviathan, pray it’s only embarrassment you suffer.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="storm">
    <line>Storms come and go, but the Leviathan rides beneath, drawn by thunder as if it were song.</line>
    <line>I once saw a storm swirl in the beast’s wake. Never again did I trust calm waters.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shark">
    <line>Sharks are wolves of the waves—fearsome, but not hateful. Leviathan eats sharks for breakfast.</line>
    <line>I once saw a shark bite Leviathan’s fin. I never saw that shark again.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tentacle">
    <line>Tentacles? You’re thinking of krakens. Leviathan’s strength is in its jaws and scale, not arms.</line>
    <line>Even krakens give Leviathan wide berth. The tentacled ones know fear, too.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="map">
    <line>Maps are useless where the sea shifts and churns. Leviathan carves its own paths in the deep.</line>
    <line>I burned my last map after meeting the beast. Some things should not be found twice.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="captain">
    <line>Once, I called myself captain. The sea and Leviathan cured me of such pride.</line>
    <line>Captains tell tall tales in taverns, but none last long against Leviathan.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>Some say the Leviathan sings to the deep. If you hear its song, it’s already too late.</line>
    <line>My nightmares echo with a whale’s lament, but it’s Leviathan’s song that wakes me screaming.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="treasure">
    <line>Many hunt for treasure, few return. The real treasure is surviving Leviathan’s attention.</line>
    <line>Gold lost at sea is nothing next to the cost of the beast’s gaze.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rum">
    <line>Rum drowns fear for a night, but come dawn, the sea and its monsters remain.</line>
    <line>I drank to forget Leviathan. It only sharpened the memory.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fisherman">
    <line>Fishermen tell tales of big catches. None speak of the ones who never return—swallowed whole.</line>
    <line>Every coastal town has a day when the boats vanish. Some whisper Leviathan’s name.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scale">
    <line>I found a Leviathan scale once, big as a shield. Too heavy to carry—too cursed to keep.</line>
    <line>Collectors seek monster scales. Most go mad, some go missing. All are fools.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="island">
    <line>Some islands are nothing but sleeping monsters. Step lightly—the Leviathan sometimes naps in shallow bays.</line>
    <line>I landed once on an island that wasn’t. The sand breathed, the ground shifted. I fled.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="harpoon">
    <line>I’ve thrown harpoons that bent like twigs against Leviathan’s hide.</line>
    <line>No weapon forged by man has yet pierced its heart, but hope is hard to drown.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ghost">
    <line>The sea is thick with ghosts and memories. Leviathan makes ghosts faster than storms.</line>
    <line>If you see a ghost ship, know that Leviathan likely haunts its past.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="depth">
    <line>The deeper you go, the stranger the world. Leviathan is king of the depths—and master of fear.</line>
    <line>I once peered into a trench so dark, my soul tried to leave my body. That’s where Leviathan lives.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>Look into Leviathan’s eye and see the abyss looking back.</line>
    <line>It blinks, the ocean quakes. I wish I’d never seen it stare.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shipwreck">
    <line>Leviathan’s trail is marked by shattered hulls and dreams.</line>
    <line>I saw it twist a galleon in two, as if snapping a wishbone for luck.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mermaid">
    <line>Mermaids warn of storms, or lure sailors to their doom. Even they flee the Leviathan.</line>
    <line>One mermaid once offered me a pearl for my silence. I have not been silent.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="legend">
    <line>Some say Leviathan is just a legend. Let them believe it. It keeps them safer than I ever was.</line>
    <line>I used to laugh at legends. Now I add to them—one scar at a time.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="anchor">
    <line>I dropped anchor once above a trench. The rope snapped—something pulled it down. I left fast.</line>
    <line>An anchor is useless when the sea itself wishes you gone.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nightmare">
    <line>My nightmares are waterlogged and endless. Leviathan is always waiting just beneath the surface.</line>
    <line>Nightmares end at dawn. The Leviathan hunts by day or night—makes no difference to it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bait">
    <line>What bait lures a sea god? Only the desperate or the damned try to find out.</line>
    <line>I’ve lost more bait than I care to remember. The beast is choosy—picks its prey.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="jaw">
    <line>Leviathan’s jaws could swallow a longship whole. I saw it once—still hear the timbers cracking.</line>
    <line>There’s no running from those jaws. Only prayer and panic.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>Strange echoes haunt the deep. Some say they are Leviathan’s laughter, mocking the living.</line>
    <line>Echoes on the water always mean you’re not alone. I row the other way now.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="riddle">
    <line>The sea loves riddles—currents, tides, and monsters. Leviathan is the answer nobody wants.</line>
    <line>Some riddles cost your life to solve. I know enough to stop guessing.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fin">
    <line>I saw a fin cut the water like a dagger. Then the whole sea rose. I’ve never felt smaller.</line>
    <line>If you spot a fin the size of a sail, set course for anywhere else.</line>

<trait name="Lich Scholar" priority="40">
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>My occupation? Some call me a scholar, others a madman. But I alone chronicle the ways of the lich.</line>
    <line>I dissect their habits, their haunts—their hunger for immortality. Ask about liches, if you wish to glimpse true horror.</line>
    <line>Knowledge is my only weapon against the undead. Liches, especially. Go on, ask me about liches.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lich">
    <line>Liches are not merely skeletons in robes. They are the pinnacle—and perversion—of necromancy.</line>
    <line>The lich craves eternity but loses everything human. To understand them, you must know about their phylacteries.</line>
    <line>What sets a lich apart is the phylactery. Their anchor to unlife. Ask about the phylactery, if your curiosity endures.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="phylactery">
    <line>The phylactery—a cursed vessel. Inside, the lich binds its very soul. Destroy it, and you destroy the lich.</line>
    <line>I spent years studying phylacteries. Each lich guards theirs with an obsession. Ask me about obsessions, if you dare.</line>
    <line>Without the phylactery, a lich is but dust. Their obsessions reveal where it's hidden. Ask about obsessions.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="obsession">
    <line>Every lich is haunted by an obsession. Gold, vengeance, forbidden lore. My nemesis? Obsessed with mirrors.</line>
    <line>Some liches hoard relics, others memories. Mine, though—he covets reflections. Ask me about mirrors, if you must.</line>
    <line>Mirrors are more than glass to my foe—they are portals, trophies, reminders of what he’s lost. Ask about mirrors.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>My life’s tragedy was wrought in silvered glass. The lich king stole my soul’s reflection in a mirror—left me a shadow.</line>
    <line>He believed mirrors would restore his lost humanity. Instead, they steal fragments of other souls. Ask about souls.</line>
    <line>Shattered glass, fractured souls. The lich king collects both. If you wish to help me, ask about revenge.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="soul">
    <line>A soul, once reflected and stolen, cannot be mended—unless the thief is destroyed. Only then will I be whole.</line>
    <line>Every night, I feel the emptiness inside—the part stolen by that monster. My only solace is the thought of revenge.</line>
    <line>If you wish to see justice done, speak the word ‘revenge’. Only then can I entrust you with my quest.</line>

    <line>Take this scroll. Slay the lich, bring me proof, and I shall reward you—and perhaps reclaim what was stolen.</line>
    <line>No words will heal my loss, but the lich’s death may. Seek him in crypts, and may your courage hold.</line>
    <line>The hunt begins. With every blow, remember: it is not only my soul at stake, but every victim’s.</line>

    <line>Ghosts are but echoes. A lich is the echo’s master.</line>
    <line>Some spirits envy the lich’s persistence. Fools, the lot.</line>

    <line>I tried wielding a staff once. Nearly lost my arm to a wraith.</line>
    <line>The lich’s staff hums with curses. Best not to touch it.</line>

    <line>Rings are common phylacteries. But not for my foe.</line>
    <line>I pawned my last ring for salt and sage. A wise trade.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="cloak">
    <line>A lich’s cloak is more for ceremony than warmth.</line>
    <line>Don’t be fooled—a tattered cloak can still conceal horrors.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="nightmare">
    <line>Liches rarely sleep, but when they do, their dreams infest the living.</line>
    <line>Nightmares are a small price for safety, I suppose.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>The moon’s phases seem to matter little to liches—darkness is their only constant.</line>
    <line>I sometimes wonder if the moon is just another cursed mirror.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="owl">
    <line>An owl once watched me study. I think it was a spy for the lich.</line>
    <line>Owl’s eyes are wise, but never trust their silence.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="dust">
    <line>Too much dust means something has lain undisturbed—and possibly undead.</line>
    <line>The scent of old dust often means a lich is near.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="wine">
    <line>Liches have no taste for wine—only the blood of memory.</line>
    <line>I keep a bottle for visitors, but none ever come twice.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="locket">
    <line>Once, I thought a locket could ward off evil. I was mistaken.</line>
    <line>The lich king shattered my hopes—and my locket.</line>

    <line>Sometimes, I hear my own regrets calling back to me.</line>

    <line>Flesh rots; bone endures. The lich cares for neither.</line>
    <line>There’s no warmth left in a lich. Only cold purpose.</line>

    <line>A lich’s shadow moves differently—sometimes it leads.</line>
    <line>Once, I tried to trap a shadow. It escaped, laughing.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="tower">
    <line>Liches favor towers for their views—and isolation.</line>
    <line>I avoid towers at night. Too many windows to watch you.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="rose">
    <line>I left a rose on a lich’s grave. The petals turned black by morning.</line>
    <line>Some say liches hate flowers. I think they just forget how to care.</line>

  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>The wind in graveyards always sounds like whispering.</line>
    <line>Beware a sudden gust. It might carry curses.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="needle">
    <line>Needles are for mending wounds—not souls.</line>
    <line>A lich’s cloak is stitched with shadow, not thread.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="star">
    <line>Stars vanish over a lich’s crypt. Even the sky is uneasy.</line>
    <line>I navigate by memory, not starlight, these nights.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="gem">
    <line>Gems tempt greed, but liches care for more precious things.</line>
    <line>Some say the lich’s eyes are twin emeralds. I say, don’t look too closely.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>I record my findings in ink, though it fades with every night spent near evil.</line>
    <line>A lich’s signature is written in terror, not ink.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="key">
    <line>Keys are useless against magical wards. Or a lich’s laughter.</line>
    <line>There is no key for the soul’s prison, only courage.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="throne">
    <line>A lich requires no throne, but sometimes sits on piles of regret.</line>
    <line>I sat on a lich’s throne once. The chill never left my bones.</line>

  <entry keyword="crown">
    <line>A lich king’s crown is a thing of bone and blasphemy.</line>

  <entry keyword="regret">
    <line>Every Lich Lord clings to a sorrow from life—a wound time could not close.</line>
    <line>His regret was his brother: a scholar, innocent and lost. My own brother…</line>

    <line>A mimic as a door is rare. If you see a door with teeth—don’t knock.</line>

  <entry keyword="boot">
    <line>Lost a boot inside a mimic. Found it months later, chewed but wearable. Mostly.</line>
    <line>A mimic’s lair is lined with mismatched boots. Their taste is questionable.</line>

    <line>A mimic’s lair echoes with strange sounds—creaks, clicks, sometimes giggles.</line>
    <line>If the echo sounds hungry, leave.</line>

  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>My profession? Scholar of monstrosities, but my true obsession is the minotaur.</line>
    <line>I have charted every hoofprint, studied every labyrinth—minotaurs are both my fascination and my curse.</line>
    <line>Ask me about minotaurs, if you wish to understand true terror… and heartbreak.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="minotaur">
    <line>The minotaur: half-man, half-beast, wholly monstrous. A riddle of muscle and malice.</line>
    <line>They dwell in twisting labyrinths, driven by rage and cunning. Do you know why they build those mazes?</line>
    <line>To a minotaur, a labyrinth is home, sanctuary, and prison. Ask about their labyrinth, if you dare.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="labyrinth">
    <line>Labyrinths are their sanctuaries, traps, and graves. I once mapped a minotaur maze—barely escaped alive.</line>
    <line>Each labyrinth is unique, an extension of its minotaur's mind. Yet, they all share one thing in common: the horned guardian at the center.</line>
    <line>If you wish to learn more, ask about their horns. There lies the heart of their mystery.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="horn">
    <line>To a minotaur, the horns are symbols—pride, strength, and their dark legacy.</line>
    <line>I lost everything to those horns—my reputation, my friends, and… my brother. Do you wish to know how?</line>
    <line>The horns are trophies and weapons both. But the greatest wound a minotaur ever dealt me was betrayal. Ask me about it.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="betrayal">
    <line>I trusted a minotaur once. A rare, clever beast—I believed I could tame it, teach it peace. I was wrong.</line>
    <line>It betrayed my trust and destroyed what I loved. I swore vengeance—not just against one, but all of its kind.</line>
    <line>Ask me about vengeance, if you’re not afraid of what it costs.</line>

    <line>Vengeance is all I have left. Ten minotaurs—ten monsters for ten years of regret. Will you help me?</line>

  <entry keyword="maze">
    <line>Not all mazes house minotaurs. Some hide treasure, others only disappointment.</line>
    <line>I once got lost in a hedge maze. Less blood, more sneezing.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="hoof">
    <line>A minotaur’s hoof leaves a crescent print—easier to track than to survive an encounter.</line>
    <line>Their hooves echo for hours in stone corridors. Hard to say if that’s comforting or terrifying.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="beast">
    <line>Many call minotaurs beasts. I call them rivals, adversaries—never mere animals.</line>
    <line>Beasts follow instinct. Minotaurs follow something darker.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>My brother was the brave one. He faced a minotaur and vanished in the maze.</line>
    <line>We speak no more of him. The labyrinth keeps its secrets.</line>

    <line>My torch once revealed a minotaur sleeping. I turned and ran.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>I have drawn dozens of maps, none truly accurate. Labyrinths shift, as do memories.</line>
    <line>Maps are comfort for the lost. They rarely save you.</line>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>Minotaurs crave the scent of blood—be it animal, or adventurer.</line>
    <line>Blood stains never wash from maze stones. I’ve tried.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>In the labyrinth, shadows twist and fool the eyes. That’s where minotaurs thrive.</line>
    <line>I learned to fear shadows before I feared minotaurs.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="cheese">
    <line>Cheese? For rats, perhaps. Minotaurs prefer the taste of trespassers.</line>
    <line>I once tried baiting a minotaur with cheese. It only made it angrier.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>Echoes carry secrets in mazes. Listen well, or risk walking in circles.</line>
    <line>I swear, sometimes the minotaurs use echoes to hunt you.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="bone">
    <line>Labyrinths are built on old bones. Some say minotaurs honor the dead. I have my doubts.</line>

    <line>Minotaurs despise wine. Something about the smell. Can’t say I blame them.</line>
    <line>Once, a minotaur destroyed a vineyard out of spite. The villagers never recovered.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="bell">
    <line>In some tales, minotaurs hate the sound of bells. Others say it drives them into a rage.</line>

  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="statue">
    <line>Labyrinths are littered with old statues—heroes, monsters, fools.</line>
    <line>I tried hiding behind one once. The minotaur wasn’t fooled.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>Some say minotaurs howl at the full moon. I say that’s wolves, not monsters with horns.</line>
    <line>The moonlight in a labyrinth is always treacherous—shadows leap at you.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="hide">
    <line>Minotaur hide is thick and tough. Some blacksmiths make boots of it—if you dare.</line>
    <line>I wear no trophies. Let others tempt fate.</line>

  <entry keyword="sword">
    <line>A sword against a minotaur is like a toothpick against a bull—useful, if you’re clever.</line>
    <line>Steel alone won’t save you in a maze.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>I bear many scars, but none from a minotaur. I prefer to keep my distance.</line>
    <line>Scars are reminders—some of foolishness, some of luck.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="treasure">
    <line>Every labyrinth promises treasure. Most only deliver danger.</line>
    <line>Minotaurs hoard little. What they guard is never worth the risk.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>Music soothes many beasts, but not a minotaur. Their ears are attuned to footsteps, not songs.</line>

    <line>I once found my coin purse atop a tree—emptied and gnawed, thanks to their mischief.</line>

  <entry keyword="hat">
    <line>My hat—an heirloom of fine felt—reduced to a nest of droppings and stolen buttons.</line>

  <entry keyword="leap">
    <line>No creature leaps like a mountain goat. From window to window, from fence to rooftop, nothing is safe.</line>
    <line>Their leaps are a mockery of gravity—and a death sentence for potted herbs.</line>

    <line>My calling? To study the Oni—their tricks, their hungers, their endless malice.</line>
    <line>Some call me an Oni scholar, others a madman. I say, wisdom demands obsession.</line>
    <line>I track their patterns, map their raids. If you truly wish to know evil, ask about Oni.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="oni">
    <line>Oni are not mere brutes—they are cunning, cruel, and delight in torment.</line>
    <line>Their laughter is thunder. Their touch is blight. Their arrival is always disaster.</line>
    <line>They haunt old ruins and sacred places. If you must know more, inquire about shrines.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shrine">
    <line>Shrines are sacred, but to Oni, they are trophies—places to desecrate and corrupt.</line>
    <line>Once, my family’s shrine was a place of peace. Now, only ashes and scars remain.</line>
    <line>Oni despise the sacred, especially the talismans that guard such places. Ask me about talismans.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="talisman">
    <line>Talismans once kept Oni at bay, inscribed by priests and blessed by hope.</line>
    <line>Break a talisman, and you break the shrine’s heart—Oni know this, and always seek them.</line>
    <line>My last talisman was shattered during the Blood Moon. Ask about the Blood Moon if you wish to hear my shame.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood moon">
    <line>The Blood Moon calls to Oni. They grow bolder, stronger, and more vicious under its glow.</line>
    <line>It was under such a moon that they came—howling, gleeful, unstoppable. I failed to defend the shrine.</line>
    <line>I have sworn vengeance ever since. If you wish to help, ask how you might take revenge.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="revenge">
    <line>Vengeance is the only cure for this poison. Will you hunt them for me?</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bone">
    <line>Oni pile the bones of their enemies as trophies. I’ve seen hills made of regret.</line>

    <line>The claw marks of an Oni never fade. I’ve seen doors splintered by a single swipe.</line>
    <line>Keep your blade sharp, but sharper still your senses. Oni claws find the careless.</line>

    <line>Oni avoid their reflections, lest they see the demons within.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rope">
    <line>Sacred ropes can repel Oni, but only if the faith behind them is strong.</line>

    <line>Oni worship the moon, especially when it’s red. Their songs are dreadful and hypnotic.</line>
    <line>Never look for the moon in Oni country. You may find more than you seek.</line>

<trait name="Ophidian Scholar" priority="40">
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>I am a scholar—some say obsessed—with the Ophidian Order. Their society, their sorcery, their secrets.</line>
    <line>For years, I have tracked the Ophidian kin. Ask me of Ophidians, if you can bear the truth.</line>
    <line>I study Ophidians. Most think them simple beasts. I know better. Ask about their magic, if you dare.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ophidian">
    <line>Ophidians: serpentine, cunning, ancient as nightmares. They slither through history’s shadows, unseen but not unfelt.</line>
    <line>Some worship them, fools that they are. But I have seen what lurks behind their scales. Their greatest weapon is not their fangs—ask me of their archmages.</line>
    <line>There are many castes—warriors, apprentices, but the archmages are the mind. The danger. Ask about archmages, and I’ll tell you what most fear to know.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="archmage">
    <line>The Ophidian Archmages wield power like a whip—cruel, precise, devastating. Their spells turn stone to sand, flesh to ash.</line>
    <line>I crossed paths with an archmage once. My finest scrolls, years of research, gone in a single hissed incantation. Do you want to know what magic they use?</line>
    <line>Archmages are rare, thank the gods, but their magic lingers where they pass. Ask me about their magic, if you’re brave—or foolish.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="magic">
    <line>Ophidian magic weaves venom and illusion. Fire that blinds, mist that burns, and whispers that rot the mind.</line>
    <line>They call their greatest spell the “Serpent’s Eclipse”—it shrouds the sun, bends the world to shadow. Do you wish to hear of their ritual?</line>
    <line>I watched an archmage conjure the Serpent’s Eclipse. The world twisted, and my companions fled in terror. The ritual is their strength—ask me how it works.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>The ritual draws power from the ancient stones of their temple, deep in the jungle. I once witnessed the beginning of it—before I was discovered.</line>
    <line>They chant in a tongue older than memory, drawing symbols in blood and venom. But the ritual is nothing without the archmage. The archmage is the heart. Ask me how to stop it.</line>
    <line>To break the ritual, you must defeat the archmage at its center. I have failed before. But with help, perhaps you can succeed. If you’re ready, say ‘vanquish’.</line>

    <line>Take this scroll. Defeat the Ophidian Archmage. Only then can their curse be broken—and my life’s work avenged.</line>
    <line>Their magic will test your mind and body. Only one who has seen the ritual can face the archmage. Bring proof of your deed—the scroll will mark your triumph.</line>
    <line>Go now, hunter of serpents. The archmage awaits. Return when the deed is done—and the sun shines free again.</line>

    <line>The archmages’ tails never touch the ground. Superstition, or pride? Perhaps both.</line>
    <line>I saw one wrap its tail around a staff. The wood blackened, and the air grew cold.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>Scaled Siriss: the knight who ruined my life. He led the raid on my home, stole my research, and left me for dead.</line>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>Their rituals are as old as stone, powered by venom and song. They believe suffering pleases their serpent gods.</line>
    <line>Each knight partakes in a venom-bonding—a secret rite in their underground temple. I alone know its location.</line>

  <!-- Red Herrings & Flavor (24) -->
  <entry keyword="warrior">
    <line>True warriors fight with honor. Orc brutes fight with rocks, spit, and insults.</line>
    <line>Never mistake size for strength of character.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>Every orc brute bears scars—badges of their idiocy. They collect wounds like others collect coins.</line>
    <line>I wear my own scars, but with a little more dignity.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="club">
    <line>A brute’s club is crude and heavy—often carved with rude symbols and bits of old bone.</line>
    <line>Most brutes treat their club as both tool and pillow. Comfort isn’t their strong suit.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="boar">
    <line>Orc brutes ride wild boars, though sometimes the boars seem smarter than their riders.</line>
    <line>Have you ever seen a boar turn on its master? It’s a rare, satisfying sight.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Brutes love fire, but fear it too. Set a bonfire near their camp and watch the confusion.</line>
    <line>Fire both lures and scares them—much like a moth, if moths smelled worse.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="helmet">
    <line>Orc brute helmets are more for intimidation than defense. Some are made of wood, some are stolen kettles.</line>
    <line>If you see a brute with a shiny helmet, it was probably a cooking pot yesterday.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="tattoo">
    <line>Brutes tattoo themselves with mud, blood, and berries. The patterns make no sense—unless nonsense is the goal.</line>
    <line>They believe tattoos make them stronger. I suspect it’s the opposite.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="bellow">
    <line>The bellow of an orc brute is enough to wake the dead—and send them running again.</line>
    <line>I have yet to meet a brute who can sing on key, but they’re always loud.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="cave">
    <line>Their lairs are dank caves littered with bones, rags, and half-eaten boots.</line>
    <line>Some say their stench keeps out wolves. I think it keeps out everything.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>Brutes howl at the new moon. No one knows why—not even the brutes.</line>
    <line>There’s a saying: ‘If you hear brutes at the moon, sleep somewhere else.’</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="anvil">
    <line>Anvils make poor weapons, but brutes will throw anything heavy in a fight.</line>
    <line>I once saw a brute knock himself out trying to swing an anvil. Poetic justice.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="smell">
    <line>The stench of an orc brute is legendary—equal parts sweat, smoke, and poor decisions.</line>
    <line>One whiff is all the warning you’ll ever need.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>Their ‘songs’ are more like threats shouted in rhythm. Earplugs recommended.</line>
    <line>I once heard a brute sing a lullaby. The nightmares haven’t left me since.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="loot">
    <line>Brutes hoard shiny objects—goblets, buckles, and the occasional goat.</line>
    <line>They value gold, but seem to eat most of it by mistake.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="camp">
    <line>Brute camps are easy to spot: smoke, noise, and broken furniture for miles.</line>
    <line>If you see a tidy camp, you’ve taken a wrong turn.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="leader">
    <line>Orc brutes respect only strength. Their leader is the loudest, angriest, and least likely to live long.</line>
    <line>Challenge the leader, and you’ll have the whole horde’s attention—briefly.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="trap">
    <line>Brutes aren’t clever, but they’re heavy. Traps that rely on brains won’t work—try a pit instead.</line>
    <line>I set a snare once. The brute ate the rope and called it a meal.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="forgehammer">
    <line>My forgehammer was my pride. Now it’s just another bent relic, thanks to brute ignorance.</line>
    <line>A brute wielding a forgehammer is a tragedy in three acts.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="bones">
    <line>Brute dens are scattered with bones. Some are from dinner, some from old enemies.</line>
    <line>If you step on a bone and hear a roar, run the other way.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="paint">
    <line>Brutes paint their faces with clay and ash before battle. It’s not war paint—it’s wishful thinking.</line>
    <line>I tried copying their paint patterns once. The chickens were terrified.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="grudge">
    <line>Everyone has a grudge against brutes—some are just more personal than others.</line>
    <line>My grudge burns hotter than their campfires.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="mockery">
    <line>Brutes mock what they fear. That’s why they mimic speech and break fine things.</line>
    <line>Never challenge a brute to a contest of wits. You’ll both lose.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="rage">
    <line>Brute rage is both their weapon and their weakness. The trick is to dodge it, not block it.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen brutes rage at rain, rabbits, even their own reflection.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="blade">
    <line>Blades taken by brutes never stay sharp for long. They prefer blunt force to skill.</line>
    <line>I lost my finest blade to a brute’s teeth. Not recommended storage.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="coin">
    <line>Brutes bite every coin, hoping it’s food. Most have broken teeth to show for it.</line>
    <line>If a brute offers you a coin, check for teeth marks—and count your fingers after.</line>

<trait name="Orc Captain Chronicler" priority="40">
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>My profession? Chronicler and scourge of the orc captains. Their every blunder, I record. Their every cruelty, I abhor.</line>
    <line>I study orc captains: their tribal wars, their garish banners, their dreadful songs.</line>
    <line>Some call me obsessed, others a nuisance. Ask me about orcs if you truly wish to understand my loathing.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="orc">
    <line>Orcs—loud, brutal, organized in their own hideous way. But the captains? They set the tone for savagery.</line>
    <line>The common orc is dangerous enough, but their captains unite chaos and cruelty. Ask about their captains if your stomach is strong.</line>
    <line>I could write a book on their rank stench alone, but the captains deserve a chapter of their own.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="captain">
    <line>Orc captains are the linchpins of their tribes—larger, meaner, more cunning than their kin.</line>
    <line>I track every captain’s rise and fall. Their scars are stories; their helmets, trophies stolen in war.</line>
    <line>I lost more than my peace to a captain named Gruksh. Ask me of Gruksh, if you dare.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gruksh">
    <line>Gruksh—may his name be spat! He led the raid on my village. My books burned, my family scattered.</line>
    <line>He wore a helm of black iron and spoke in riddles and threats. My life’s work reduced to ash at his command.</line>
    <line>Yet I am no coward. I shadowed Gruksh to his lair. Ask about his lair, if you wish to know true peril.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lair">
    <line>The lair: a cave deep in the blackwood, marked by skulls and stinking fires. Few enter and fewer return.</line>
    <line>Gruksh guards his spoils—books, loot, even my old writing desk—behind orcish traps and loyal guards.</line>
    <line>But every lair has a weakness. Ask about weaknesses, if you would see Gruksh fall.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weakness">
    <line>Orc captains are strong, but pride blinds them. Gruksh mocks any challenger, believing himself invincible.</line>
    <line>If one were bold—and skilled enough—they might slay him and scatter his tribe. Will you accept the challenge? Say ‘slay’ if you are ready.</line>
    <line>I can offer a quest scroll for any brave soul. Utter ‘slay’ and I shall prepare your doom—and his.</line>

    <line>Words cannot undo his evil, but a single act of courage can. Slay Gruksh the Orc Captain, and this scroll will mark your victory.</line>
    <line>The tribe will crumble without him. Take this, and return with Gruksh’s medallion as proof.</line>

  <entry keyword="helmet">
    <line>Orc captain helmets are crude but effective—thick, jagged, impossible to wear with dignity.</line>
    <line>I once tried on an orc helm. The lice haunted me for a month.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="banner">
    <line>Orc banners are daubed with blood and filth. They march behind them, bellowing nonsense.</line>
    <line>Once, I deciphered their symbols—mostly insults and threats. Colorful, in a manner of speaking.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Orcs love fire, but rarely for warmth. It’s for burning, destroying, boasting.</line>
    <line>Never trust an orc with a torch near your library.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tribe">

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="loot">
    <line>Orcs prize loot, no matter how useless. I once saw a captain wearing three left boots and a chamber pot.</line>
    <line>They measure status by the weight of their sacks, not the contents.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="drum">
    <line>Their war drums sound like thunder with indigestion. Makes a scholar’s work impossible.</line>
    <line>When the drums beat, you either hide or fight.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>Each captain boasts scars like medals. The bigger the scar, the louder the tale behind it.</line>
    <line>I suspect half are self-inflicted for effect.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="raid">
    <line>Orc raids are sudden, violent, and rarely well-planned. But their captains improvise with frightening skill.</line>
    <line>If your village is too quiet, check the treeline for green skin and sharp teeth.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="language">
    <line>Orcish language is a collection of curses, threats, and creative insults.</line>
    <line>I speak it poorly—mostly words for surrender or “please stop biting.”</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>Orc songs are less music, more declarations of intent to smash, burn, and eat.</line>
    <line>They sing after victory, before battle, and sometimes during meals. My ears may never recover.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boar">
    <line>Some orc tribes ride boars into battle. The smell is… unforgettable.</line>
    <line>I saw a captain thrown from a boar once. The boar won the argument.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ale">
    <line>Orcish ale can strip the paint from a shield. Only the bravest—or stupidest—drink it willingly.</line>
    <line>I traded a jug for information once. The headache lasted three days.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tattoo">
    <line>Captains wear tattoos as marks of honor or territory. Some look like maps. Or possibly stew recipes.</line>
    <line>I once tried to copy an orc tattoo for my notes. The ink ate through the page.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="axe">
    <line>Orc captains love axes—usually large, sometimes sharp, always filthy.</line>
    <line>I measured one for my research. Needed two assistants just to lift it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feast">
    <line>Orc feasts are noisy, dangerous, and short on utensils. Never attend as the guest of honor.</line>
    <line>Captains demand the first bite and the last word—usually “more!”</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>Orcs howl at the moon before battle. I’m not sure if it’s tradition or indigestion.</line>
    <line>They claim it brings luck. I think it brings trouble.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chain">
    <line>Captains love chains—wearing them, swinging them, rattling them for effect.</line>
    <line>I tried to study orcish metallurgy. I still can’t get the grime out from under my nails.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mud">
    <line>Mud is both armor and decoration for orcs. Captains use it to mark rank. Or possibly to avoid baths.</line>
    <line>I suspect their greatest enemy is soap.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shaman">
    <line>Every tribe has a shaman—usually old, toothless, and cranky. Captains tolerate them, barely.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen a shaman curse a captain’s boots. He limped for a week.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shield">
    <line>An orc shield is as much for bashing as for blocking. Captains decorate theirs with bones.</line>
    <line>I wouldn’t trust one to stop a thrown pebble, but orcs aren’t picky.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="soup">
    <line>Orc soup is a mystery—ingredients best left unnamed. Captains claim it builds strength. I say it builds regret.</line>
    <line>I sampled it once. Once.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smoke">
    <line>Orc camps always stink of smoke—burning meat, wood, and whatever else they find.</line>
    <line>Hard to tell if it’s for cooking or for hiding the smell of orcs themselves.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bone">
    <line>Bones serve as currency, jewelry, and weapons among orcs. Captains wear the biggest ones as trophies.</line>
    <line>I once mistook a captain’s necklace for soup bones. He didn’t see the humor.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="victory">
    <line>Orc captains celebrate victory with bellowing, chest-beating, and more than a little property damage.</line>
    <line>Once, a captain tried to declare victory before the battle. It didn’t end well for him.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="throne">
    <line>A captain’s throne is rarely more than a big rock or a pile of stolen crates. Still, they sit on it like kings.</line>
    <line>I asked to sit on a captain’s throne once. The tribe laughed for hours. So did the captain.</line>

    <line>My profession? I observe and chronicle the uncanny ways of Ortanord.</line>
    <line>Some call me their biographer, others their nemesis. Truth is, I am both.</line>
    <line>I’ve watched Ortanord dance through the forests for years. Ask about Ortanord, if you’re brave—or foolish.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ortanord">
    <line>Ortanord—those leafy fiends, guardians and terrors of the deep wilds.</line>
    <line>They say Ortanord is made of bark and malice, a spirit in wooden armor.</line>
    <line>I have followed Ortanord for seasons uncounted. Ask me about the grove they haunt, if you wish to hear more.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>Their grove is ancient—a sanctuary for their kind, and a grave for the unwary.</line>
    <line>Roots twist, mist lingers, and Ortanord’s shadow falls on all.</line>
    <line>Once, the grove sheltered beauty. Now, it is overrun. Ask about the blight that changed everything.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blight">
    <line>Blight spread like ink through parchment. The trees sickened. Ortanord grew cruel.</line>
    <line>I witnessed the first withering leaf—since then, Ortanord has become my obsession and my curse.</line>
    <line>I lost something dear to the blight—ask me about the violin, if you must.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="violin">
    <line>My violin’s music once kept the blight at bay. Ortanord shattered it, silencing hope.</line>
    <line>I played beneath the ancient oaks—until Ortanord’s wrath found me, and broke my song in half.</line>
    <line>Now, all that remains is longing—and the thought of vengeance. Ask how you might bring retribution.</line>

    <line>I dream of the violin’s song—sometimes I still hear its echo in the grove.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="artifact">
    <line>Bone artifacts from the old crypts fetch a high price. Too bad most are dust now.</line>

    <line>I lost a good walking stick to an OsseinRam once. It made for a quick snack.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grave">
    <line>OsseinRams don’t respect graves. To them, every burial is a buffet.</line>

    <line>Bone shards litter the floor after battle. Each is a fragment of tragedy.</line>

    <line>To create a Patchwork Skeleton is to desecrate a dozen lives. Some call it art. I call it evil.</line>

    <line>What do I do? I study, catalog, and—against my will—battle the mysterious moving bandages that plague our land.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bandage">
    <line>Bandages, you say? Most are harmless, tools of healing. But some—some twitch and crawl when no one’s looking.</line>
    <line>I have spent years studying bandages: linen, silk, charmed, and—most fearsome—those corrupted by plague.</line>
    <line>Ask about Pestilent Bandages, if you dare. But beware—knowledge may itch worse than the wounds.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pestilent bandage">
    <line>Pestilent Bandages are the nightmares of every healer. Filthy, writhing wrappings, animated by old hospital curses and the hatred of forgotten wounds.</line>
    <line>They once saved lives, now they spread sickness and terror. Some say they whisper secrets in the night.</line>
    <line>If you wish to know how they came to be, ask about the hospital.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hospital">
    <line>It was the old Nightgate Hospital—abandoned, haunted, overflowing with tragedy. I worked there once, tending the dying.</line>
    <line>In those halls, bandages were used again and again, never burned. Disease clung to every fiber, every knot and fold.</line>
    <line>If you would understand my obsession, ask me about infection. That’s where all ruin begins.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="infection">
    <line>Infection—merciless, creeping, unseen. It took my mentor, my friends, and, worst of all, my trust in medicine.</line>
    <line>The Pestilent Bandages are not merely rags—they are the memory of every neglected wound, every fatal mistake.</line>
    <line>What remains for me? Only vengeance. Only the cleansing fire. Ask me about vengeance, if you’re bold enough.</line>

  <entry keyword="mummy">
    <line>People joke that Pestilent Bandages long for a mummy to wrap. Trust me, their ambitions are far more sinister.</line>
    <line>Once, I wrapped a turnip like a mummy to amuse a child. It vanished overnight—never again.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="lint">
    <line>Lint collects in every pocket, but bandage lint is the worst. Sticky, persistent, impossible to banish.</line>
    <line>One patient believed lint was lucky. He did not survive the operation.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="ointment">
    <line>Ointments help wounds, but they are powerless against the animated bandages. I tried. The smell still haunts me.</line>
    <line>I once tried to bribe a Pestilent Bandage with balm. It only grew slicker—and angrier.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="herb">
    <line>Herbs can ward off illness—sometimes. Against the crawling bandages, only steel seems to work.</line>
    <line>My herb sachets vanished from my bedside, replaced by tiny footprints. Linen hates competition, I suppose.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>I wear my scars with pride—reminders of battles fought, lost, and occasionally won against the bandaged menace.</line>
    <line>Every scar has a story. Most involve running faster than I ever thought possible.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="healer">
    <line>Healers are often blamed for curses. I do what I can, but sometimes the wounds bite back.</line>
    <line>The bandages took more than patients. They took hope, too.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="wrap">
    <line>To wrap a wound is to trust the cloth. Now, I trust nothing that doesn’t struggle in my grip.</line>
    <line>Beware loose wrappings at night—they slither when you’re not looking.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="sanctuary">
    <line>I once believed the hospital was a sanctuary. Turns out, sanctuaries make the best lairs for monsters.</line>
    <line>If you seek sanctuary from bandages, keep moving. They hate the restless.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="nurse">
    <line>The nurses were the first to notice the disappearances. Some say they heard laughter from the linen closets.</line>
    <line>I still hear the echo of footsteps—nurses running from their own bandages.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="itch">
    <line>There’s an itch that no scratching cures. Bandages can crawl beneath your skin—figuratively, I hope.</line>
    <line>The worst itch is fear. Hard to scratch that one.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="ghost">
    <line>Ghosts, spirits, curses—I've faced them all. Animated bandages are somehow worse. They remember.</line>
    <line>I tried speaking with a ghost once. Even it feared the bandages.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="stain">
    <line>Every bandage tells a tale: blood, ink, and things best forgotten. Stains are history written in red.</line>
    <line>If a bandage resists cleaning, burn it. Trust me.</line>

  <entry keyword="night">
    <line>Night is their favorite time. The sound of slithering linen will keep you awake—if you’re lucky.</line>
    <line>I once dreamt of dancing bandages. I woke up bound to my own bed.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="wound">
    <line>Bandages are supposed to heal wounds, not create them. The world is full of cruel ironies.</line>
    <line>Some wounds are better left uncovered—especially when the bandages move on their own.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="burn">
    <line>Fire is the surest cure. Burn every cursed bandage you find. Do not hesitate.</line>
    <line>Smoke from burning linen smells of revenge—and regret.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>If you feel itchy after talking to me, it’s probably just nerves. Probably.</line>
    <line>Some say the itch never fades. I try not to think about it.</line>

  </entry>
  <entry keyword="scream">
    <line>Hospitals echo with screams. The silent ones are the worst—usually muffled by cloth.</line>
    <line>If you hear a bandage scream, you’ve already lost.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Bandages avoid mirrors. Perhaps they dislike seeing their own unraveling.</line>
    <line>When in doubt, check your reflection. Animated linen never casts one.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="needle">
    <line>Needles terrify some, but the bandages are immune. I tried pinning one to a board. It wriggled free.</line>
    <line>A needle can close a wound. It can’t close a curse.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="laundry">
    <line>Never leave bandages in the laundry overnight. They multiply—or disappear.</line>
    <line>I caught a Pestilent Bandage hiding in a laundry basket. It nearly cost me my hand.</line>

    <line>Rebirth is the phoenix’s curse. Fire consumes it, and from ruin, it returns—uninvited, unrepentant.</line>
    <line>I have watched a phoenix burn and rise more times than I care to remember. Each time, I lost something precious.</line>
    <line>Rebirth is a cruelty for those left behind. My greatest loss was at the hands of a rising. Ask me of loss, if you must.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="loss">
    <line>Loss is the legacy of phoenixes. The fire took more than my orchard—it took my family’s memory, and my peace.</line>
