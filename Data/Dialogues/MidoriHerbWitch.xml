      You find a woman crouched among twisted roots, her kimono earth-stained, stringing pungent herbs while a fat, beady-eyed tanuki perches on a nearby stump, tail twitching.<BR><BR>
      She looks up, green eyes glinting with humor and suspicion.<BR>
      <I>“Careful, outsider. Step too close and you’ll trip my mushroom wards—or worse, rouse Chibi here. Speak your need, or share a tale for a cup of something strong.”</I><BR><BR>
      The tanuki cackles. “Midori’s brews taste better than her threats! Well, sometimes.”

    I was cast out with nothing but a blade of rivergrass and my own name stripped. So I took a new one—<B>Midori</B>, after the color of stubborn life.”<BR>

    Midori chuckles. “Because he begged. With words. And with eyes so full of spirit, I couldn’t bear to let him die. Tanuki are tricksters, yes—but also guardians. He was young, foolish, and nearly drowned by poachers.”<BR>

    Chibi puffs up. “I am her guide, her gossip, and her glutton. I know every root that sings and every fox that lies.”<BR>
