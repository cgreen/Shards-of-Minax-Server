      Before you, half-lost in the swirling snow, stands a hooded figure wrapped in the eerie blue-black folds of a Glacier Shroud. Pale eyes flicker, reflecting the distant shimmer of the Obelisk of Veyra. He does not speak at first—only nods, then gestures with a gloved hand to the icy wastes.<br><br>
      After a silence that stretches, a low, gravelly voice finally emerges.<br><br>

      A FrostbittenSteed—once a wild mount, now twisted by Minax's cold shadow—haunts the northern pass. It tears through our traps, tramples our food stores, drives prey from the land.<br><br>
