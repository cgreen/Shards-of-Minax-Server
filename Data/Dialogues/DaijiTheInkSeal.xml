      You find a slender man in a meticulously pressed kimono, seated cross-legged behind a lacquered desk. His ink-stained hands move in fluid, graceful arcs as he inspects an endless stack of scrolls. Without looking up, he intones:<BR><BR>
      “Greetings, petitioner. I am Daiji, Ink-Seal and Record-Keeper of Hinokami. What business brings you before the registry? Please, mind your manners—every word is immortalized in ink.”

      Daiji straightens, pride evident.<BR><BR>

      Daiji’s brush dances mid-air.<BR><BR>
      “Calligraphy is the soul poured onto paper. One’s brushwork reveals character: bold, timid, deceitful, honest. To sign in haste is to live without honor.”
