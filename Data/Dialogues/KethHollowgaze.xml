      A solitary figure sits half-shrouded in shadows. A tribal mask hides his face, but pale eyes glint through the hollowed wood.<BR><BR>

      He hesitates. “Names lose meaning in exile. But once, I was Keth—scout, shadow-walker, voice for the council in darker places. Now... the tribe calls me traitor. Perhaps they are right.”

      Keth traces the edge of his mask. “They say I aided Minax’s agents. The truth is knotted. I followed orders, shadowed invaders... but when the council fell, it was my mask they found at the fire. Someone framed me, but exiles have no voice.

      He turns, mask expressionless. “Without a name, a face is just another secret. I wear this not to hide, but to remember—who I was, and what I must become. When my name is cleared, perhaps I will take it off. Until then, let the mask bear my shame.”
