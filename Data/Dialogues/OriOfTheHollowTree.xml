      In a small clearing, a figure hunched over a fallen log traces intricate runes into bone. Around them, flutes, whistles, and animal talismans dangle from branches. Ori mutters to each in turn: “Patience, little owl. Courage, wolf tooth. You’ll sing soon enough…”
      <BR><BR>
      Sensing you, Ori’s eyes dart up—half wary, half wild.
      <BR><BR>
      “Do you hear them too? The bones whisper when the wind is right. But I need a listener with living ears. What brings you beneath the hollow tree?”
