      I keep it honest. Cheats, poisoners, or cowards—I break ‘em. Simple as that. The only thing I hate more than a cheat is a cultist. Especially those Minax scum slithering in my shadows."

      I keep them safe—when I can. That’s harder these days. Poison in their drinks, black magic in their wounds. Someone wants the pits broken, and it stinks of Minax."
