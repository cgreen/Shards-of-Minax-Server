      Before you stands a hulking man, brow furrowed, jaw set like stone. Bone fragments decorate his leather armor, and his hands bear the scars of both the forge and battle.<BR><BR>
      He sits cross-legged, eyes closed, murmuring a chant. As you approach, he exhales, opens his eyes, and gives you a cautious nod.<BR><BR>
      "You walk the groves with purpose, stranger. I am Grun Thornjaw, once berserker, now smith. If you seek blades or wisdom, speak. But be wary—my forge holds old anger I’ve yet to quench."

      Grun’s gaze turns inward.<BR><BR>
      "I was rage given flesh, once. Led warbands. Broke men and monsters with my fists. But anger eats more than enemies—it devours kin, soul, and sleep.<BR>
      The shamans taught me to shape rage into steel. Now, each blade is a vow: for defense, never vengeance."

      He pauses.<BR>

      Grun lowers his voice.<BR><BR>
