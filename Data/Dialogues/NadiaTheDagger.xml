      A tall, sharp-eyed woman leans against a pillar, hood shadowing her features. The glint of a crimson blade at her side leaves no doubt: this is Nadia the Dagger.<BR><BR>
      She nods once, as if sizing you up.<BR>
      “Most people in the Undermarket don’t dare speak to me. Either you’re new, or you’re reckless. What do you want?”

      I’ve been a caravan blade, a bodyguard, and an executioner by request. Now I’m my own master—or as close as you get in Zahid’s shadow.”

      Nadia crosses her arms.<BR>
      “Born in chains. Sold between merchant princes like a bolt of silk.<BR>
      Learned to fight because nobody cared if a slave girl lived. Learned to kill because that’s the only way to live free.<BR>
      The Sapphire Caravans tried to break me. Zahid gave me a blade and let me choose my targets.”<BR>
      She shrugs.<BR>
      “Now I choose who I trust, who I follow, and who I cut. Some days, I even sleep.”
