<trait name="Undead Cheese Enthusiast" priority="40">
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>My job? Once, I coaxed curds into gold. Now, I curdle blood by candlelight.</line>
    <line>I was a master of the rind and the crypt—ask about cheese if you have the stomach.</line>
    <line>Even in death, the scent of aged gouda haunts my hollow bones.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cheese">
    <line>Cheese... the only thing I crave more than mortal warmth.</line>
    <line>Blue, hard, runny, or veined—I knew them all, before the worms knew me.</line>

  <!-- 24 Red Herrings / Flavor Keywords -->

  <entry keyword="grave">
    <line>My grave smells faintly of parmesan. Perhaps I should have washed my hands before death.</line>
    <line>The worms are good company, but lack subtlety in their taste.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mold">
    <line>Once, mold crowned my cheese. Now it colonizes my coffin. I try not to take offense.</line>
    <line>The living fear mold. I find it... comforting.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="milk">
    <line>Milk—white as a ghost, but with far more nutritional value.</line>
    <line>I sometimes dream of milking a phantom cow. She vanishes at dawn, alas.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="skeleton">
    <line>It’s hard to make cheese with bony fingers, but I try. The mice appreciate my efforts.</line>
    <line>People say I have no guts for cheese anymore. They’re technically correct.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="laughter">
    <line>Laughter curdled the milk of my soul, once. Now it just echoes in the empty crypt.</line>
    <line>Cheese and laughter—both better when shared, both spoiled in solitude.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>The moon is a wheel of camembert, hung too high for my greedy hands.</line>
    <line>Moonlit cheese tastes best—especially when you’re already dead.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="decay">
    <line>Decay is misunderstood. It brings flavor to cheese and depth to the grave.</line>
    <line>Let me tell you, I’ve aged better than most brie down here.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rot">
    <line>Rot is a spectrum. On cheese, it’s a delicacy. On flesh, a necessity.</line>
    <line>I rot with dignity, if not with style.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bone">
    <line>I stir the curds with my own femur. Gives it a certain... richness.</line>
    <line>Bones rattle, but not as much as my hunger for cheddar.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="haunt">
    <line>I haunt the dairy’s edge, yearning for just one more whiff of stilton.</line>
    <line>The living say I’m a ghost. I say I’m a customer with dietary restrictions.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="salt">
    <line>Salt preserves cheese, and tears preserve regret.</line>
    <line>I weep salt—bad for cheese, worse for eye sockets.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cellar">
    <line>Our cellar was legendary for its aromas—now it’s just legendary for its screams.</line>
    <line>Nothing matures cheese like the chill of a crypt.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="brie">
    <line>Brie is the spirit’s cheese—soft, yielding, and a little too pungent for the living.</line>
    <line>I once hid inside a brie wheel for a prank. The aftermath was unspeakable.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="maggot">
    <line>Maggots: unwelcome in cheese, common in my left ear. Life is unfair.</line>
    <line>If you find maggots in your cheese, send them my regards. They’re family.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="love">
    <line>Love ferments, just like cheese. Sometimes, it goes a little blue.</line>
    <line>They say true love never dies. Clearly, they never tried my wife’s Limburger.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flesh">
    <line>I once craved cheese. Now, I crave flesh—preferably served with crackers.</line>
    <line>Undead flesh and aged cheddar—both best when left undisturbed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="memory">
    <line>Every cheese I ever tasted is a memory—sharp, crumbling, sometimes moldy.</line>
    <line>Memories fade. The scent of Roquefort never does.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dairy">
    <line>Dairy brought us together. Death only slightly soured things.</line>
    <line>Milk curdles, bones break, but love (and cheese) endures.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rind">
    <line>The rind is the cheese’s armor—mine, alas, has long since flaked away.</line>
    <line>Respect the rind. It keeps the flavor in, and the maggots out.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="crackers">
    <line>Crackers are for the living. The dead prefer things with a bit more... crunch.</line>
    <line>Pair cheese with crackers. Pair loneliness with eternity.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bite">
    <line>One bite of my wife’s aged cheddar, and you’ll see the other side—literally.</line>
    <line>I’m known for my bite. Just ask the local gravekeeper’s shin.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="midnight">
    <line>Midnight is cheese hour in the crypt. No one to complain about the smell.</line>
    <line>I slice cheese in the moonlight. No one notices, except the shadows.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weep">
    <line>Sometimes I weep for my lost love. Sometimes I just leak embalming fluid. Hard to tell the difference.</line>
    <line>To weep over cheese is tragic. To weep over lost cheese is necromancy.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shroud">
    <line>I wrap myself in my shroud, and dream of fondue.</line>
    <line>A cheesecloth shroud would be appropriate, but sadly, the worms would feast.</line>
  </entry>

<trait name="Undead Oculist" priority="40">
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>My job? I watched. I peered. I gazed beyond the veil, unblinking.</line>
    <line>I was an oculist, a scholar of orbs and sockets—ask about eyes, if you dare stare back.</line>
    <line>Now, I see little in the dark except regrets and the glimmer of old obsessions.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eyes">
    <line>Eyes—windows, keys, playthings for those who study the mind’s abyss.</line>
    <line>I shared everything with my companion, the Gazer Savant. We saw things together. Beautiful, terrible things.</line>
    <line>Ask about our research. But mind you, some sights cannot be unseen.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="research">
    <line>Our research was forbidden. Optic rituals, mirror gazing, dissecting the gaze of monsters.</line>
    <line>They called us mad—yet knowledge was our only disease.</line>
    <line>Ask about our madness, if you’re curious what love looks like with too many eyes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="madness">
    <line>Madness? Love is a kind of madness—ours was swollen, pulsing, rimmed in red.</line>
    <line>We saw through each other, literally—ask about our favorite specimen.</line>
    <line>I still dream of floating orbs and the whispers in the iris.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="specimen">
    <line>Our favorite specimen was the gazer—eyes stacked atop eyes, each one staring, pleading.</line>
    <line>We spent sleepless nights sketching their pupils, listening to their gaze. It brought us close—so close I still feel their stare.</line>
    <line>Ask about what I miss most, if your nerves are steady.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="miss"
         itemType="FactionDeliveryQuestScroll"
         ctorArgs="Gazer Savant,Undead,500">
    <line>I miss their gaze. Not just my beloved’s, but all the gazes, all the eyes that watched with us.</line>
    <line>Take this message scroll to my Gazer Savant—only then can I rest in peace, with sockets empty but soul fulfilled.</line>
    <line>Deliver it, and may your own eyes remain in your head a little longer than mine did.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- 24 Red Herrings / Flavor Keywords -->

  <entry keyword="socket">
    <line>Empty sockets are windows for ghosts. Sometimes, something looks back.</line>
    <line>I fill mine with pebbles so the worms don’t get too cozy.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="veil">
    <line>The veil is thin, like an eyelid about to blink. Don’t ask what’s underneath.</line>
    <line>One day, you’ll see through it. Not all vision is a blessing.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="orbs">
    <line>Some collect coins. We collected orbs. Less lucrative, more slippery.</line>
    <line>When you juggle orbs, sometimes they blink back at you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pupil">
    <line>The pupil is a trapdoor, and behind it? Secrets, shadows, and the things that twitch at night.</line>
    <line>Mine are dilated permanently. Death is one long, black stare.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Mirrors lie. But sometimes, if you stare long enough, they tell the truth, and you wish they hadn’t.</line>
    <line>I haven’t seen my reflection since my face rotted off. Small mercies.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gaze">
    <line>A gaze can pierce or caress. Ours did both, sometimes in the same night.</line>
    <line>Careful—some things gaze back with hunger.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="stare">
    <line>Staring contests are dull when one of you has no eyelids.</line>
    <line>I can outstare anyone—except the darkness.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="iris">
    <line>The iris blooms with colors in life. Now mine is a shriveled wreath for memory.</line>
    <line>I tried to tattoo runes on my iris once. Let’s say the results were… eye-opening.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sight">
    <line>Sight is overrated. True vision comes when your eyes have rotted away.</line>
    <line>I see more now than ever, and less that I care to.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="socket">
    <line>Empty sockets are drafty in winter. You’d be surprised what crawls in.</line>
    <line>I stuff mine with lint. Fashion is eternal, unlike flesh.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blink">
    <line>I can’t blink anymore. It’s all staring, all the time. No rest for the wicked—or the dead.</line>
    <line>Blink and you’ll miss it. Or lose an eye, like I did.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tears">
    <line>I weep no more, but sometimes ichor oozes from the emptiness. The worms seem to like it.</line>
    <line>Tears of joy, tears of rot—it’s all the same when you’re dead inside.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pearl">
    <line>Pearls are just eyes that forgot how to see. I wore them as buttons. Fashion is vision, too.</line>
    <line>I tried to swallow a pearl once. Choked to death. Worth it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>Eyes whisper secrets if you listen close enough. Mine never shut up, even now.</line>
    <line>Sometimes, the whispers are just maggots. Sometimes, not.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Shadows have eyes, too, if you look long enough. They look back, if you’re lucky.</line>
    <line>I cast no shadow now. I think it got bored and left me behind.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bleed">
    <line>Eyes bleed colors the living never see. It’s quite beautiful, in a screaming sort of way.</line>
    <line>My last tear was red as a sunset. Now, only dust trickles out.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nerve">
    <line>Optic nerves tangle like lovers’ arms. Cut one, and the world goes dark—romantic, isn’t it?</line>
    <line>Nerves of steel, eyes of jelly. Nature’s cruel joke.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pluck">
    <line>Plucking eyes is an art. Not everyone appreciates the craftsmanship.</line>
    <line>I miss the sound—a wet pop, a sigh, and then peace.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="monster">
    <line>Monsters have the best eyes—glowing, twitching, full of stories you’ll never tell again.</line>
    <line>I’ve stared into a monster’s gaze. It winked.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="touch">
    <line>Touching eyes is intimate—too intimate, some would say.</line>
    <line>I used to caress orbs lovingly. Now I mostly just drop them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="veil">
    <line>The veil between worlds is a membrane—thin, moist, easily pierced.</line>
    <line>One day, we’ll all peer through it, like gazers at a show.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eyelid">
    <line>Eyelids are curtains for secrets. Mine have rotted away; the show never ends.</line>
    <line>I envy those who can still blink away horror.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vision">
    <line>Vision is a blessing and a curse. I have all curse, no blessing left.</line>
    <line>Sometimes I see the living through my old eyes. They never notice.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="companion">
    <line>My companion was my twin in obsession—no one else understood our gaze. Still alive, still searching, still seeing.</line>
    <line>Tell them… I never stopped looking for them, even after my own eyes went dark.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="savant">
    <line>The Gazer Savant: so brilliant, so bright, so… alive. Treasure their vision while you can.</line>

  </entry>
</trait>


<trait name="Bereft Anatomist" priority="40">
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>My job? I once peeled back the mysteries of flesh. Now I’m little more than a specimen myself.</line>
    <line>I taught anatomy by candlelight—my students were ghouls for knowledge. Ask about study, if you dare.</line>
    <line>The scalpel was my brush, the corpse my canvas. I do miss my lectures…</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="study">
    <line>Oh, the joy of study! The thrilling rustle of a forbidden tome, the soft squelch of sinew under blade.</line>
    <line>I studied with the only soul who matched my appetite for the grisly: the Ghoul Scholar. Do you know them?</line>
    <line>We dissected secrets together, bathed in lamplight and regret. Ask about our partnership if you aren’t squeamish.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="partnership">
    <line>We were inseparable—bonded by our thirst for knowledge, and the pungent aroma of formaldehyde.</line>
    <line>The Ghoul Scholar was the keenest mind I ever met. Their theories on decomposition made my marrow sing.</line>
    <line>If you care for such things, ask about our passion. But mind your stomach.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="passion">
    <line>Our passion was anatomy—alive or otherwise. The Ghoul Scholar claimed no subject was truly dead until catalogued.</line>
    <line>Together, we mapped the language of rot and the poetry of marrow. But the grave silenced my voice first.</line>
    <line>I would give anything for one more night in the lab… Ask what I regret, if you wish to know pain.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="regret">
    <line>I regret nothing, save my inability to hold a scalpel—or my beloved Ghoul Scholar’s hand.</line>
    <line>I regret leaving them to sort skeletons alone. The best minds rot fastest, it seems.</line>
    <line>Still, a message must be delivered. Ask about the message, and perhaps I can rest easier.</line>

    <line>Take this scroll to the Ghoul Scholar. Let them know my mind is sharp as ever, though my flesh is not.</line>

  <!-- 24 Red Herrings / Flavor Keywords -->

  <entry keyword="corpse">
    <line>They make for patient students, but their questions are usually a bit stiff.</line>
    <line>It’s hard to get feedback from the deceased, but they never interrupt my lectures.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rot">
    <line>Rot—nature’s finest sculptor. I appreciate its artistry on both the inside and out.</line>
    <line>The best ideas come to me when something is putrefying nearby.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scalpel">
    <line>Sharpness is next to godliness. I still dream of the cold gleam before the first cut.</line>
    <line>Hard to wield without tendons. These days, I’m more subject than surgeon.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="marrow">
    <line>Marrow—the secret filling of life’s eclair. Delicious in theory, dangerous in practice.</line>
    <line>The Ghoul Scholar once wrote a sonnet to marrow. It was… moist.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ghoul">
    <line>Ghouls are underappreciated—brilliant conversationalists, if you don’t mind the gnawing.</line>
    <line>They never let a morsel go to waste, not even bad puns.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lecture">
    <line>My lectures cleared a room faster than the plague—such is the price of truth.</line>

    <line>Once I organized a bone recital. The xylophone performance was unforgettable.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tome">
    <line>Books bound in flesh are hard to come by. Harder still to return to the library.</line>
    <line>The smell of a good tome beats embalming fluid any night.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="decomposition">
    <line>Decomposition is just life working backwards. Some of my best ideas unravelled the same way.</line>
    <line>Everything falls apart eventually, but some of us do it with style.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="formaldehyde">
    <line>The scent of formaldehyde—bracing, like a slap from an ex-lover.</line>
    <line>I used to dab it behind my ears. Kept suitors at bay and corpses fresh.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grave">
    <line>The grave is roomy if you don’t mind the company. Privacy is another matter.</line>
    <line>I had mine lined with lecture notes—now the worms are far better read than I ever was.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="skin">
    <line>Skin: the body’s gift wrap. Mine’s seen better birthdays.</line>
    <line>Never judge a book by its cover—unless that cover is skin, then be extra suspicious.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tongue">
    <line>The tongue is the deadliest muscle. I’ve bitten off more than I can chew, and I have proof.</line>
    <line>I miss arguing with the living. They don’t scream as much as the dead do.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dissect">
    <line>To dissect is to understand. To be dissected is… less enjoyable, but instructive.</line>
    <line>Once I dissected a shadow. Now I can’t sleep at night.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="anatomy">
    <line>Anatomy: the intimate cartography of flesh. We mapped it together, my GoreFiend and I.</line>

    <line>The GoreFiend Scholar—my living companion, the last pulse in my memory.</line>

    <line>Ask about our bond—if your stomach is as strong as your curiosity.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bond">
    <line>We shared a bond of blood and intellect, stitching hearts and harvesting horror.</line>
    <line>We learned that true love means knowing exactly what’s inside someone… and cataloguing it.</line>

    <line>I long for the slippery joy of discovery—the thrill of peeling back secrets with my GoreFiend.</line>

    <line>Nerves get frayed—both the anatomical and the emotional kind.</line>
    <line>I’ve lost my nerve. It ran off with my patience and my spleen.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="marrow">
    <line>Marrow is the butter of the bones. Delicious, if you like your food haunted.</line>
    <line>She would sip marrow with a silver spoon. Decadent.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="pulse">
    <line>The living have a pulse. The dead have rhythm.</line>
    <line>I keep time by the drip of embalming fluid. It’s a slow dance.</line>
  </entry>

  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="kiss">
    <line>Her kisses lingered—iron-sweet, and a little sticky.</line>
    <line>I haven’t felt a kiss in ages. These days, I settle for maggot cuddles.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="remains">
    <line>What remains is all that matters. The rest is just gristle and gossip.</line>

    <line>Gorillas—noble, hairy, terribly misunderstood. We admired their wisdom, their fists, their dietary habits.</line>
    <line>I wrote treatises on simian rage; my companion taught them to read. Ask about my companion—the only one who truly understood me.</line>

  <entry keyword="miss">
    <line>I miss debate. I miss the rustle of pages and fur, the stench of intellectual exertion.</line>
    <line>I miss the way they’d hurl manuscripts when I proved them wrong. Or right. Or just because.</line>

    <line>I sleep under spilled reagents. They hum in my dreams.</line>

  <entry keyword="wolves">
    <line>Ah, the noble wolf—snarling, savage, misunderstood. Like me, but fluffier.</line>
    <line>We followed packs for months. Slept in dens. Ate what they ate. Sometimes raw. Sometimes still warm.</line>
    <line>My companion still runs with them—on two legs, sadly. Ask about my companion, if your stomach can take it.</line>

    <line>Teeth are currency. Wolves understand this. So do the undead.</line>

    <line>Even now, the thought of venison makes my jaw ache. And clack.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tongue">
    <line>I miss her tongue. Not in a creepy way. Okay, maybe a little.</line>
    <line>She spoke in growls and nips. I understood every syllable.</line>

  <line>Now I don't sleep at all. Just pace and whisper and bleed a bit.</line>
</entry>

  <line>We cradled hydra hatchlings once. Like infants. Very bitey infants.</line>
  <line>One grew attached. Literally. Took weeks to detach it.</line>
</entry>

<entry keyword="breath">
  <line>Hydra breath is like grave dust and wet onions. Strangely nostalgic.</line>
  <line>I breathed it in for years. Now I exhale cobwebs.</line>

  </entry>

    <line>Memory freezes like water—clear at first, then cracked and cloudy.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>I once saw myself in a frozen mirror. I screamed. The mirror cracked. We’re even.</line>
    <line>Ice shows truth—mostly veins, sometimes regret.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scream">
    <line>Her scream froze the lab walls. They still echo. I measured the reverb for fun.</line>
    <line>I scream now only when I thaw. It’s involuntary.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flesh">
    <line>My flesh stiffens in the cold. Which is always. Death is surprisingly... rigid.</line>
    <line>I once mistook my forearm for a popsicle. Regret is flavorless.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cold">
    <line>The cold is inside me. It whispers. It wants to study me back.</line>
    <line>I haven’t been warm since the avalanche. Or since her embrace. Hard to say.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="thaw">
    <line>When I thaw, I cry. When I freeze again, the tears become daggers. Efficiency.</line>
    <line>Thawing's just a fancy word for falling apart in slow motion.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="death">
    <line>Death was colder than I expected. Less paperwork, though.</line>
    <line>They say you die with your mouth open. I froze mid-sentence.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="iceberg">
    <line>An iceberg took my career, my lungs, and my luggage. I still miss that hat.</line>
    <line>I tried to marry an iceberg once. She was distant. But understanding.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>The whispers in the frost aren’t mine. Anymore.</line>
    <line>I used to transcribe them. Now I just listen and nod.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glow">
    <line>The northern glow reflects nicely off my exposed ribs. Bit garish, though.</line>
    <line>Her eyes glowed once, near the rift. I miss that glow. The smell, not so much.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="intern">
    <line>The interns were enthusiastic. Until they began cracking open mid-lecture.</line>
    <line>I named one Frosty. He lasted longer than most of our relationships.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>Snow is the world’s way of hiding corpses beautifully.</line>
    <line>I once made a snow angel. It screamed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="researcher">
    <line>Being a researcher means asking questions no one else will. Like: “Will it scream if frozen?”</line>
    <line>I was peer-reviewed. The peers died. But they reviewed me, eventually.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shiver">
    <line>I shiver sometimes—not from cold, but from memory.</line>
    <line>She shivered too. Right before the elemental touched her spine.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="skin">
    <line>Skin is optional when researching cold resistance. Turns out, so is breathing.</line>
    <line>Mine peeled off like parchment. Very readable. Not reusable.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rime">
    <line>Rime builds up on my bones if I stand still. I like it. Feels like a hug.</line>
    <line>She once traced words in the rime. I think they said "Help". Or "Hug".</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="elemental">
    <line>The elemental we summoned still lingers. I hear it humming in my femur.</line>
    <line>Beautiful thing—pure ice, pure hunger, pure academic funding.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="study">
    <line>We studied cold phenomena. Eventually, we became one.</line>
    <line>My last paper was a scream frozen into thesis format.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="frozen">
    <line>I’m frozen solid most days. On good days, I can blink.</line>
    <line>My soul has frostbite. I’ve stopped thawing it. Too painful.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>The wind howled her name for days after the accident. Or maybe that was me.</line>
    <line>Wind off the glacier cuts deep. So did her final critique.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="companion">
    <line>She was my partner in frost. My colleague in cold. My muse in misery.</line>
    <line>She left before I finished defrosting. Typical scholar.</line>

    <line>Jackrabbits—fast, twitchy, and full of guilt. We hunted them together, you know.</line>

  <entry keyword="passion">
    <line>Passion? Oh, we hunted for the thrill... the squirm... the twitch of fur in moonlight.</line>
    <line>They snapped necks while I wrote poetry in entrails. It was love. Pure, bloody love.</line>

    <line>I miss the thump of terrified paws. I miss her laugh as the snares tightened.</line>

  <entry keyword="burrow">
    <line>I lie in one now. They used to scream in theirs. It’s the little parallels that bring comfort.</line>
    <line>Burrows are warm. Graves are not. Unless you’re being spooned by regret.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ears">
    <line>Soft little antennae of terror. I used to collect them, dry them, whisper to them.</line>
    <line>One still hangs from my clavicle. For luck. For memory.</line>

    <line>Sometimes, I twitch too. Residual joy, perhaps.</line>

    <line>I still find tufts in my ribcage. Memories molted in blood.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scream">
    <line>Jackrabbit screams are high-pitched and humanlike. Like lullabies sung through a flute made of fear.</line>
    <line>I recorded them once. Played them at our wedding. Reception was... memorable.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="love">
    <line>They say love is patient. Ours wasn’t. It ambushed from the thickets and struck with fangs.</line>
    <line>I still feel their love. It nibbles at me like a guilt-ridden rodent.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="prey">
    <line>Prey teaches you respect. It also teaches you how to clean a knife with your teeth.</line>

  <entry keyword="whisker">
    <line>Whiskers are sensitive, like memories. I braided them into a noose once. Sentimental reasons.</line>
    <line>I miss plucking them. They made a sound, like a harp strung with nerves.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>Bunny bones snap like secrets. Small, fast, unavoidable.</line>
    <line>I played jacks with their bones. So many games, so few survivors.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="night">
    <line>Night is when the twitching began. And so did the love.</line>
    <line>I still crawl through warrens at midnight. Old habits die with difficulty. Or don’t.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>They danced through traps, a symphony of violence and grace.</line>

    <line>I rot with purpose. A bunny doesn’t.</line>
    <line>Funny how death preserves obsession. Like a jam jar full of regret.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nest">
    <line>I made her a nest once. Out of sinew and apologies.</line>
    <line>She refused. Said it wasn’t "aesthetically aggressive" enough.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>Kappa... the cucumber-eating river goblins. Tricksters, surgeons, saints of drowning.</line>
    <line>I loved them. Still do. Even now, I hear their gurgling laughter in my ear canals.</line>
    <line>My companion and I spent years studying them. Ask about my companion—if you dare.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="companion">
    <line>Ah, my dear one. Still among the living. Still decoding kappa intestines while sipping tea.</line>
    <line>They never understood why I let the kappa take my soul. It was for the *research*.</line>
    <line>We shared more than knowledge. We shared an obsession. Ask about it, if you have the stomach.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="obsession">
    <line>We dissected tales and turtles alike. Nothing was sacred—not even the living.</line>
    <line>Our obsession bloomed in darkness, nourished by brine and madness.</line>
    <line>I kept things... mementos... in jars. Ask about the jar. Just one. My favorite.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="jar">
    <line>A kappa’s arm, still twitching. My companion said it winked once.</line>
    <line>I whispered to it. Named it. Fed it cucumbers soaked in blood. It was our child, in a way.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>I wrote in squid ink and ichor. Calligraphy by candlelight, with screaming quills.</line>
    <line>Ink stains. So do sins.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="river">
    <line>The river took my breath. And gave me gills. Temporarily.</line>
    <line>Kappa live in rivers. I died in one. Coincidence? No.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cucumber">
    <line>Kappa adore cucumbers. So do I—when they’re pickled in madness.</line>
    <line>Once, I offered one a cucumber. It offered back a toe. I accepted.</line>

    <line>The shell of a kappa is smooth. Like a skull, but with more memories.</line>
    <line>I wore one once. The screaming stopped—for a while.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>A kappa tried to pull mine through my rear. Traditional, but rude.</line>
    <line>I still feel it tugging sometimes, like seaweed in the dark.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>The gurgle of a drowning man is music to a kappa. I sang for them often.</line>
    <line>Sometimes I gurgle back, just to feel heard.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>My memories are jarred—literally. Ask the right questions, and I’ll unscrew one for you.</line>
    <line>Don’t open the third jar. It bites.</line>

  <entry keyword="pickled">
    <line>Pickled emotions age well. Especially fear and longing.</line>
    <line>I’m pickled too, in a way. Brined in regret and swamp water.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tea">
    <line>My companion made tea of swamp herbs. It dissolved spoons and inhibitions.</line>
    <line>They said it helped them see the kappa. I just saw my ancestors, screaming.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="toes">
    <line>Kappa love toes. I only had eight when I died. Coincidence? Unlikely.</line>
    <line>I offered my pinkie toe as tribute. It was accepted with slurping gratitude.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gills">
    <line>I carved gills into my neck once. For science. They didn’t work. But I *heard* better.</line>
    <line>Now I wheeze like a lungfish. It’s charming, in the right company.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eggshell">
    <line>We hatched ideas like eggs—fragile, gooey, and full of horror.</line>
    <line>I used an eggshell as a ritual bowl once. My tongue never healed.</line>

  <entry keyword="scholar">
    <line>Scholarship is madness in formal wear. I wore a bowtie once. It screamed.</line>
    <line>I miss footnotes. They never argued.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="drown">
    <line>To drown is to be embraced by silence. And teeth.</line>
    <line>They say you see a light. I saw scales and judgment.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="liver">
    <line>Kappa love livers. I tried to remove mine in anticipation. Turns out, you need it.</line>
    <line>I don’t recommend the ritual. Very messy. Very final.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>I avoid mirrors. I don’t like what blinks back.</line>
    <line>My reflection once asked for cucumbers. I obliged. It smiled.</line>

    <line>Madness? No, I prefer to call it deep scholarship.</line>
    <line>Everyone calls you mad *until* the kappa wave back.</line>

    <line>Our first ritual summoned three toads and a disappointed librarian.</line>
    <line>We refined it. Less disappointment, more blood.</line>

    <line>The emptiness echoes. Sometimes it answers.</line>

    <line>One of my eyes floated off during a dive. The fish are still laughing.</line>
    <line>I see better without it. Or maybe just differently.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fur">
    <line>I wake with phantom fur in my mouth. My tongue remembers what the rest of me can’t.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="claws">
    <line>I filed my nails to claws once, to impress her. Now they just scratch inside my coffin.</line>
    <line>Claws make poor pens but excellent conversation stoppers.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tail">
    <line>Panthers have tails. I no longer do. Jealousy is unbecoming—but so is decay.</line>
    <line>Her favorite game was tug-the-tail. Mine was scream-and-bleed.</line>

  <entry keyword="purr">
    <line>I once purred back at a panther. It misinterpreted that as consent.</line>
    <line>They say undead cannot purr. I disagree. It’s just... wetter now.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>One fang, tucked in a locket, still hangs around my brittle neck.</line>
    <line>They say I whispered to it too much. It whispered back.</line>

    <line>I tried roaring once. All that came out was a lung.</line>
    <line>Her roar shook the ink bottles. Mine just attracted flies.</line>

    <line>Now I growl back at the worms. They ignore me, mostly.</line>

    <line>We hunted knowledge, then prey, then each other’s sanity.</line>

    <line>She laughed as I choked on one. I died minutes later. Coincidence?</line>
    <line>Now I cough dust. It lacks charm.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="teeth">
    <line>I kept my molars in a velvet box. She said they looked like ivory cabochons.</line>

    <line>My grave is lined with tiny sapphires. I still can’t sleep.</line>
    <line>The worms appreciate my collection. Philistines.</line>

    <line>Quartz speaks if you listen closely. Usually insults, sometimes prayers.</line>
    <line>My bones are riddled with quartz now. I'm technically priceless.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fingers">
    <line>Gemcutting with bone fingers is difficult—but not impossible.</line>
    <line>I lost three fingers. Traded them for raw amethyst. Worth it.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="caress">
    <line>She caressed gems like they were lovers. I watched. I wept. I polished.</line>

    <line>Job? Once I devoured tomes, not brains. Now the only books I touch are dust and regret.</line>
    <line>I was a librarian—ask about books if you dare.</line>
    <line>Now I’m more mold than scholar, but my hunger for knowledge persists. Ask me about what I miss.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="books">
    <line>Books were my passion—bound, forbidden, occasionally screaming.</line>
    <line>My favorite shelf was the one that burst into flames if you mispronounced “Vermis.”</line>
    <line>I shared everything with my beloved—ask about my companion if your spine tingles.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="companion">
    <line>My companion? Oh, a mind like wildfire—she studies the Efreet, creatures of smoke and fury.</line>

    <line>Ask about Efreet if you wish to see the burn marks on my soul.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="efreet">
    <line>Efreet—burning intellects, tempers hotter than crematory coals.</line>
    <line>She chased their secrets; I only wished to chase her shadow.</line>
    <line>Our greatest joy was deciphering old flame-riddles together. Ask about riddles if you’re not afraid of heat.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="riddles">
    <line>We solved riddles written in smoke—some answers, best left unbreathed.</line>
    <line>Now I speak only in ashes, and she in fire. I ache for her words.</line>

  <entry keyword="flame">
    <line>Flame destroys, but it also reveals. I learned that the hard way—my eyebrows never grew back.</line>

    <line>Ink stains on fingers, pages, and hearts.</line>
    <line>I ran out of ink once. Tried blood. Poor results.</line>

    <line>I chill every room I enter, but only out of habit.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="study">
    <line>We studied the arcane together—notes written in haste and terror.</line>
    <line>Study hard, die young. Study harder, die undead.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>My job? I once worshipped the oval, the fragile, the sublime. Now I haunt chicken coops and dream of shells cracking in the dark.</line>
    <line>I was an Egg Devotee—ask about eggs, if you dare. But beware, some yolks are best left undisturbed.</line>
    <line>Life was sunny side up. Death... a little more scrambled.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="egg">
    <line>Eggs—the source of all joy and all nightmares. I adored them in life; in death, I crave what I cannot have.</line>
    <line>I could poach, boil, or devour them raw. Now my cravings are eternal—and unsatisfied.</line>
    <line>Ask me about my companion, if you wish to taste sorrow mixed with shell.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="companion">
    <line>My companion—the living Egg Enthusiast—still tends her flock. She collects, caresses, and sometimes names the eggs. I miss her terribly.</line>
    <line>We shared everything: recipes, secrets, even the occasional cracked shell. She called me her Rotten Darling.</line>
    <line>Ask about our collection, if you want to know what we truly loved.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="collection">
    <line>Our egg collection was infamous—speckled, brown, blue, and blood-streaked. Every shell a memory. Every yolk, a secret.</line>
    <line>We kept eggs from creatures living and dead, some best left unfound. She kept the rarest ones locked away—ask about the rarest egg, if your curiosity outweighs your sanity.</line>
    <line>I would trade my remaining teeth for one more look at our treasures.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rarest">
    <line>The rarest egg? Not golden, nor jeweled. It pulsed—warm, alive, almost whispering. We called it the Death's Embrace Egg.</line>
    <line>My companion still guards it. If you wish to help me, ask about the message I must send her.</line>
    <line>But beware, the egg’s gaze lingers long after you look away.</line>

    <line>You are braver—or more foolish—than most. Take this scroll to my beloved Egg Enthusiast. Tell her the yolk still binds us.</line>
    <line>Deliver it, and perhaps the Death's Embrace Egg will finally crack. Or perhaps you will.</line>
    <line>My gratitude will ooze through eternity—and perhaps you’ll earn favor with those who cherish eggs... and the undead.</line>

    <line>Some say eggshells crunch underfoot. I hear them crunch inside my head.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="yolk">
    <line>Yolk, the golden soul of the egg. I dream of its warmth, but taste only dust.</line>
    <line>Don’t trust a yolk that never breaks. They harbor secrets far older than breakfast.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>Boiling eggs is simple. Boiling your regrets? Much harder.</line>
    <line>I sometimes simmer in my own melancholy, much like a forgotten pot on the fire.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="crack">
    <line>Crack an egg, free a spirit. Or maybe the other way around.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scream">
    <line>Eggs don’t scream, but sometimes I do. Quietly, into the void.</line>

  </entry>

    <line>Sometimes I try to unscramble my thoughts, but the result is never palatable.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hatch">
    <line>They say every egg hatches in its own time. I’m overdue by several centuries.</line>
    <line>Hatching is rebirth. I only managed the death part.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="white">
    <line>Egg whites—pure, bland, insipid. Like most ghosts in the afterlife.</line>
    <line>Stains on my shroud remind me of spilt egg whites. Both are hard to clean.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>Eggs have no eyes, yet I feel them watching. Always watching.</line>
    <line>I lost an eye in the coop, once. The rooster never apologized.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="morning">
    <line>Morning used to mean fresh eggs. Now it means another day in the dark.</line>
    <line>I dread sunrise. The living wake, the eggs are taken, and I remain.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Shadows are longer near the chicken coop. Sometimes they peck back.</line>
    <line>I cast no shadow, but I remember the feel of one on my skin.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flesh">
    <line>Eggs contain the promise of flesh. I contain only regret.</line>
    <line>Sometimes I wish I could trade my rotten flesh for a fresh egg. No one accepts the deal.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>The grave is a cradle for those too tired to hatch again.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feast">
    <line>Feasts are for the living. I nibble on memories—slimy, undercooked.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mother">
    <line>Mothers protect eggs. I only haunt them.</line>
    <line>My own mother said I’d come to a bad end. She never said I’d come back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cobweb">
    <line>Cobwebs make poor nests but excellent disguises.</line>
    <line>I sometimes wrap eggs in cobwebs, just for the texture.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="foul">
    <line>Foul eggs, foul moods, foul fate. I’m familiar with all three.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>Eggs sleep in their nests. I sleep with the worms.</line>
    <line>Sleep brings dreams of eggs. Wakefulness brings only the grave.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="passion">
    <line>Our passion was gems—sharpened by longing, cooled by jealousy.</line>

  </entry>
  <entry keyword="jewel">
    <line>I tried swallowing jewels for sustenance once. The taste is unforgettable—like swallowing a scream.</line>
    <line>Jewels keep secrets better than skulls. And both are hard to crack.</line>

  <entry keyword="grave">
    <line>My grave sparkles faintly. They say it’s dew—liars, it’s fragments of broken gems and promises.</line>

  <entry keyword="giant">
    <line>Giants are crude copies of Ettins—one head, half the personality.</line>
    <line>I tried to befriend a giant once. It ate my field notes. And my left shoe.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="teeth">
    <line>Ettins collect teeth for luck. I collect teeth because they keep falling out.</line>
    <line>I bit an Ettin once. It bit back. That’s why I talk like this now.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nightmare">
    <line>Nightmares? I dream in double—two screams, two shadows, always running, always caught.</line>
    <line>An Ettin’s nightmare is being alone. Mine is waking up with someone else’s head.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ruin">
    <line>Ruin is my home now—crumbling stones and the scent of wet earth.</line>
    <line>Once we found an Ettin lair in a ruin. Now, I haunt my own.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feet">
    <line>Ettin feet are a marvel—six toes, twice the aroma. I still have dreams about them. Dark, fetid dreams.</line>
    <line>They say feet carry you places. Mine mostly carry worms.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="split">
    <line>Split heads, split hearts, split lives. Ettins taught me division—and loneliness.</line>
    <line>I split hairs now, mostly to keep the lice busy.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="twin">
    <line>Twin souls in one shell. That was our motto. Now, I’m half-empty and she’s all alone.</line>
    <line>Twins are nature’s Ettins, but with less clubbing.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="paradise">
    <line>Paradise? An Ettin on each side, telling secrets until the world ends.</line>
    <line>I hear there’s a paradise for Ettins. I just hope the beds are wide enough.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="obsession">
    <line>Obsession keeps the dead moving, and the living up at night.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="regret">
    <line>Regret is a heavy club, and I was never quick enough to dodge.</line>
    <line>I regret many things, but not my love for Ettins. Or for her.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scent">
    <line>Scent is memory’s anchor. Ettins smelled of peat, smoke, and unwashed hope.</line>
    <line>Now I smell only of grave dirt and missed chances.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>Echoes fill the ruins, bouncing like Ettin arguments across broken stones.</line>
    <line>I talk to echoes now. They rarely disagree.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Shadows are double here. Mine lags behind, sulking in corners.</line>
    <line>An Ettin casts two shadows. I cast only doubt.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="toes">
    <line>Counting Ettin toes is a hobby for the patient. I lost count—and a finger.</line>
    <line>My own toes are less interesting now. More…detached.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sketch">
    <line>My companion’s sketches captured every bulge, every boil. I keep them close, pressed to my hollow chest.</line>
    <line>Sketching Ettins required quick fingers and a strong stomach.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clubbed">
    <line>To be clubbed by an Ettin is to know true pain. To love one is worse.</line>
    <line>I once dreamed of being clubbed to death. Dreams come true.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="heartbeat">
    <line>My heart beats only in memory. Ettins have two hearts, I’m told. Lucky beasts.</line>
    <line>Heartbeat is a distant drum now, drowned out by worms and regret.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mocked">
    <line>The living mocked our passion. Now they mock my shamble. Circle of unlife, really.</line>
    <line>Mockery never bothered me—except when it came from an Ettin’s left head. They’re cruel.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rotting">
    <line>Rotting is a process—Ettins rot twice as fast, or so I hear.</line>
    <line>I rot slowly. Her absence speeds the decay.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="remains">
    <line>These ruins are full of remains. Some Ettin, some human, all unquiet.</line>
    <line>All that remains is longing and a faint smell of mossy armpits.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="laughter">
    <line>Laughter echoed through Ettin camps—and through our home. Now it’s just me, and the groaning wind.</line>
    <line>Sometimes I laugh to remember. Sometimes to forget. Mostly, I just wheeze.</line>

  <line>Ink lasts longer than love. And it smells worse.</line>

  <line>My shroud is knotted twine. I tangle, and I smile.</line>

  <entry keyword="bird">
    <line>Ah, bird—golden-skinned, crackling, stuffed with despair and rosemary.</line>
    <line>We basted together under the stars. My beloved turned the spit, and I sang to the sizzling.</line>

  <entry keyword="passion">
    <line>Our passion was pure and impure: satyrs, in all their frisky glory.</line>

    <line>The forest remembers us. The trees lean in when I pass, whispering old rites.</line>
    <line>We lost something sacred there. And three interns.</line>
