  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>My calling? I study and catalog the most wretched abominations—Gazers.</line>
    <line>To some I am a scholar, to others a lunatic. The truth? I am the world’s foremost Gazer nemesis.</line>
    <line>Ask me about Gazers. If you value your sanity, tread carefully.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gazer">
    <line>Gazers—levitating horrors with too many eyes and even more secrets.</line>
    <line>Some call them magical marvels. I call them nightmares with tentacles.</line>
    <line>If you wish to know more, ask about their eyes. But beware what you seek.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>Each Gazer’s eye is unique—swirling, unblinking, filled with cosmic malice.</line>
    <line>They see far more than mere mortals. Their gaze pierces armor, and sometimes, the soul.</line>
    <line>Why do I despise them? The answer lies in my past. Ask about my brother.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="brother">
    <line>My brother was a mage—gifted, curious, too bold for his own good.</line>
    <line>One night, he sought to bind a Gazer. He believed knowledge could be tamed.</line>
    <line>The Gazer stole his sight, his mind, and—some say—his very essence. I have sworn vengeance. Ask me about revenge, if you dare.</line>

  <entry keyword="revenge">
    <line>Vengeance is my life’s work. The Gazer that took my brother yet haunts these lands.</line>
    <line>I have studied their haunts, their rituals, their every weakness. Still, they mock me with every blink.</line>

  <!-- Red Herrings / Flavor -->
  <entry keyword="tentacle">
    <line>Each tentacle has a mind of its own—writhing, grasping, always searching.</line>
    <line>A tentacle’s touch burns worse than a flame. I keep scars as reminders.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blink">
    <line>Gazers never blink—not really. That’s why sleep eludes me.</line>
    <line>They say if you stare at a Gazer long enough, you forget how to close your eyes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="float">
    <line>Gazers float above the ground—no footsteps, no warning. Only a chill in the air tells you they’re near.</line>
    <line>The way they drift...like a bad thought you can’t shake.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="magic">
    <line>Gazer magic is ancient and chaotic—raw power twisted by madness.</line>
    <line>Never challenge a Gazer at a contest of spells. Their magic bites back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spell">

    <line>One spell of theirs turned a friend into a frog. He never forgave me for laughing.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="library">
    <line>Books on Gazers are rare—many scholars go mad before finishing their research.</line>
    <line>I keep my notes under lock and key. Some knowledge hungers to be known.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>A mirror confuses a Gazer, if you believe old tales. I’ve yet to test it. Cowardice or wisdom?</line>
    <line>Once I caught a Gazer admiring itself in a pond. The world nearly ended from vanity.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fear">
    <line>They feed on fear—sometimes I wonder if my obsession only makes them stronger.</line>
    <line>I have learned to swallow fear, but it never stays down for long.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scholar">
    <line>Other scholars study butterflies or ancient coins. I study Gazers. Someone has to.</line>

  <entry keyword="sanity">
    <line>Sanity is a luxury for those who don’t stare into a Gazer’s eye. I make do with caution.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cult">
    <line>There are those who worship Gazers, believing them to be gods. Madness wears many faces.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>I dream of Gazers. Their eyes haunt my sleep, staring from every shadow.</line>
    <line>Sometimes I dream I am the Gazer. Those nights, I wake up screaming.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="loss">
    <line>Loss is a teacher—and a wound that never closes. My brother’s laughter still echoes, somewhere.</line>
    <line>I have lost much to Gazers. But never my resolve.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="riddle">
    <line>Gazers love riddles, but their answers lead only to madness.</line>
    <line>Ask them a question, and you’ll wish you hadn’t understood the reply.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="orb">
    <line>Some say their orbs hold stolen souls, swirling within. I don’t care to find out firsthand.</line>
    <line>A Gazer’s orb pulses with otherworldly light. Staring too long brings headaches—and visions.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hide">
    <line>I have hidden from Gazers in barrels, chimneys, even coffins. None were comfortable.</line>
    <line>Don’t try to hide from their gaze. They see more than you can imagine.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="book">
    <line>My research fills a dozen tomes, each more unsettling than the last.</line>
    <line>If you find a book bound in blue leather, leave it. Some knowledge is best forgotten.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="teeth">
    <line>Gazers have teeth—did you know? Hidden behind the eyes. That’s why I flinch at dentists.</line>
    <line>I collected a Gazer tooth once. It hummed in the moonlight. I buried it the next day.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="curse">
    <line>Their curses linger. My shadow moves on its own, some nights.</line>
    <line>Breaking a Gazer’s curse is possible. Surviving the attempt, less so.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="soup">
    <line>Once tried making Gazer-eye soup. Bad idea. The soup blinked back.</line>
    <line>If anyone offers you soup in this village, ask about the recipe first.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lantern">
    <line>A bright lantern may keep a Gazer at bay. Or maybe it just makes it easier for them to find you.</line>
    <line>I carry two lanterns at night—one for seeing, one for swinging.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trade">
    <line>I don’t trade in artifacts anymore. Last time, a Gazer followed me home.</line>
    <line>If you find Gazer relics, burn them. Don’t ask how I know.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="madness">
    <line>Madness is a Gazer’s greatest gift—and its cruelest curse.</line>
    <line>The boundary between brilliance and madness grows thin the more you study them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hat">
    <line>I wear hats with wide brims—to block unwanted gazes and falling debris.</line>

<trait name="Ghoul Scholar" priority="40">
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>My vocation? I catalog, pursue, and, when fortune favors, eradicate ghouls from these lands.</line>
    <line>Some call me a scholar, others a ghoul-hunter. But to me, I am their most fervent observer—and their sworn enemy.</line>
    <line>I know every habit, hunger, and haunt of the ghouls. If you’re curious, ask me about ghouls.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ghoul">
    <line>Ghouls are graveyard vermin—undead fiends who devour the dead and defile the earth.</line>
    <line>No creature is as wretchedly cunning or as insatiably hungry as the ghoul. Their appetite is legendary.</line>
    <line>I have studied their habits for years. Their haunts, especially, are worth asking about.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="haunt">
    <line>Ghouls lurk in forgotten graveyards and ancient crypts—anywhere shadows cling to bone and memory.</line>
    <line>Their haunts are marked by overturned earth, gnawed bones, and a stench of spoiled dreams.</line>
    <line>One haunt, in particular, changed my life—the desecrated tomb of my own kin. Ask about tomb if you wish.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tomb">
    <line>It was my family tomb, passed down for generations. The ghouls ravaged it—leaving ruin and heartbreak.</line>
    <line>I discovered the tomb defiled, every casket opened, every keepsake stolen or shattered.</line>
    <line>Their hunger for flesh is only rivaled by their greed for grave-goods. If you care to know more, ask about keepsakes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="keepsake">
    <line>Among the scattered bones, I found my mother’s locket—gnawed, ruined. It was a final insult I cannot forgive.</line>
    <line>The ghouls steal mementos, hoping to lure the living into their grasp. My quest for vengeance began with that locket.</line>
    <line>Vengeance is my only solace. If you seek justice as well, ask me about vengeance.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vengeance">
    <line>Vengeance is all I have left. I cannot rest while ghouls defile our dead and our memories.</line>
    <line>Would you help me bring justice to these carrion fiends? If you have the courage, say ‘hunt’.</line>
    <line>To cleanse the graves and reclaim peace, ten ghouls must fall. Ready yourself, and say ‘hunt’ if you accept.</line>

  <!-- Red Herrings / Flavor Keywords (24) -->
  <entry keyword="crypt">
    <line>The air in crypts is always cold, but not as cold as a ghoul’s touch.</line>
    <line>I’ve spent more nights in crypts than I care to admit—haunted by memories and monsters alike.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flesh">
    <line>Ghouls hunger for flesh, whether old or fresh. Nothing else sates them.</line>
    <line>Few things unsettle me more than the sound of gnawing in the night.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bone">
    <line>Ghouls grind bones to powder, searching for marrow like greedy children after sweets.</line>
    <line>If you find a pile of chewed bones, beware—ghouls are near.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>They say the ghouls grow bolder under a waning moon—perhaps they draw power from the darkness.</line>
    <line>I have learned to fear the full moon, for that’s when graveyards grow restless.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fear">
    <line>To know ghouls is to know fear. They are terror made flesh—or rather, un-flesh.</line>
    <line>Fear sharpens the senses, but ghouls sense fear as keenly as blood.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="graveyard">
    <line>Graveyards were once places of peace. Now, they are feasting halls for ghouls.</line>
    <line>If you must pass through a graveyard at night, carry salt and iron. Trust me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="salt">
    <line>Salt is said to keep the dead in their graves. I line every threshold with it.</line>
    <line>I’ve sprinkled salt on bones—sometimes it works, sometimes not. The ghouls are clever.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="iron">
    <line>Iron is a ward against dark magic, so the old tales claim. My blade is always iron—for hope, if not for effect.</line>
    <line>Ghouls do not fear iron, but I feel braver when I hold it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smell">
    <line>You can smell a ghoul before you see it—like spoiled meat and wet earth.</line>
    <line>The stench of a ghoul lingers long after they’re gone.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="night">
    <line>Ghouls own the night. Daylight scatters them, but they return at dusk with renewed hunger.</line>
    <line>The bravest souls don’t linger in graveyards at night. I’ve learned that lesson well.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="family">
    <line>Ghouls are solitary, but I wonder if they remember their families—the ones they once were.</line>
    <line>I have lost family to ghouls. That pain never truly leaves you.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>A ghoul’s bite is poison—feverish, cold. Only the strongest survive it.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="curse">
    <line>Some say ghouls are cursed souls, trapped by their hunger and hate.</line>
    <line>Curses linger where ghouls walk. I never ignore the whispers of the dead.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Ghouls cling to the shadows, hiding from torchlight and hope alike.</line>
    <line>If your torch flickers in a crypt, beware—the shadows may move.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shovel">
    <line>I keep my shovel close—not just for digging, but for fending off ghouls at close quarters.</line>
    <line>A true ghoul-hunter never trusts a shovel left standing upright.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="prayer">
    <line>I have recited every prayer I know over the graves, but still the ghouls come.</line>
    <line>Some say a strong prayer can hold ghouls at bay. I wish I still believed it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="coin">
    <line>In olden times, coins were placed on the eyes of the dead to pay for peace. The ghouls take them anyway.</line>
    <line>Every coin gone from a grave is another small theft by greedy hands or hungry monsters.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scrap">
    <line>Ghouls leave scraps of cloth and flesh behind—morbid reminders of their feasts.</line>
    <line>Every scrap I find tells a story I’d rather forget.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>Sometimes the graves whisper. Some voices are memories, some warnings. Some are hungry.</line>
    <line>I have followed whispers into darkness, and found only regret.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="claw">
    <line>The claws of a ghoul are sharper than any blade. I’ve seen them tear stone as easily as flesh.</line>
    <line>A single claw mark on a tomb is enough to warn me away for weeks.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rotting">
    <line>Rotting flesh is a ghoul’s perfume, their badge and their camouflage.</line>
    <line>The smell of rot carries far in the night air. I have learned to follow it—carefully.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chant">
    <line>Old folk chant in the night to keep the ghouls away. Sometimes, I join them, for comfort’s sake.</line>
    <line>A chant in the graveyard at midnight may draw ghouls—or drive them off. I do not take chances.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="locket">
    <line>That locket was all I had left of my mother. Now, it’s ruined—another thing the ghouls took from me.</line>
    <line>I sometimes dream of finding that locket whole. It always ends in heartbreak.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>I do not sleep easily—not since the ghouls came. Every dream is haunted.</line>
    <line>To sleep in a graveyard is to risk never waking—except as prey.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lantern">
    <line>A lantern’s light flickers, but it can keep a ghoul at bay—if only for a moment.</line>
    <line>I’ve lost more lanterns to trembling hands than to the wind.</line>

    <line>Spiders weave the world together, eight legs at a time. But the giant black widow is no humble weaver—it is a legend in silk and venom.</line>

  <entry keyword="black widow">
    <line>The giant black widow is a monster made of shadow and silk—sharper than steel, deadlier than nightshade.</line>
    <line>They hide in darkness, waiting for prey... or revenge. For one in particular stole something precious from me.</line>
    <line>To truly understand my obsession, you must ask of the ring. That cursed ring changed everything.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ring">
    <line>It was my grandmother’s ring—worn since childhood, lost one foolish night in the old crypts.</line>
    <line>A glint of silver, a flash of legs, and it was gone—spirited away by a black widow into her web.</line>
    <line>I have chased rumors and webs ever since. If you care to hear more, inquire about the crypt.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="crypt">
    <line>The crypt beneath the ruined chapel is their nest now, thick with silk and bones.</line>
    <line>I ventured there once, heart pounding, torch sputtering. I barely escaped, ringless and haunted by webs.</line>

  <entry keyword="revenge">
    <line>Revenge is a thread I have followed all my life. Will you help me sever it?</line>

  <!-- Step 1: job -->
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>My occupation? I study the enigmatic Giant Ice Worms of the north—monsters both beautiful and ruinous.</line>
    <line>Some call me a worm sage, others an obsessed fool. Truthfully, I am both.</line>

  <!-- Step 2: ice worm -->
  <entry keyword="ice worm">
    <line>Giant Ice Worms are miracles of frost—beasts that tunnel through glacier and snow, chilling the land as they go.</line>
    <line>They shimmer with cold light beneath the ice, but leave only ruin behind. If you wish to know their habits, ask about tunneling.</line>
    <line>Admire them, but never trust them. If you want to hear the tragedy of their tunnels, ask me about tunneling.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Step 3: tunneling -->
  <entry keyword="tunneling">
    <line>Tunneling is their art and their weapon. They spiral through frozen earth, undermining villages and collapsing roads.</line>
    <line>The pattern of their tunnels is like music—deadly music. But it was tunneling that destroyed my research outpost.</line>
    <line>Through their tunneling, they unearthed my sanctuary and ruined all. What they seek below is as mysterious as their cold hearts. Ask about crystals, if you seek to understand.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Step 4: crystals -->
  <entry keyword="crystals">
    <line>The worms crave the ancient frost crystals hidden deep in the glacier’s heart. Those gems are older than memory itself.</line>
    <line>Frost crystals are both their lure and their doom—feeding on their power, the worms grow vast and voracious.</line>
    <line>I once held a frost crystal, studied its beauty—until the worms sensed it and came. My work shattered. If you wish to know what I lost, ask me of my journal.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Step 5: journal -->
  <entry keyword="journal">
    <line>My journal held decades of knowledge—stolen in a single, slithering night. The ice worms dragged it into the deep, with all my notes.</line>
    <line>I hear its pages flutter beneath the ice, mocking me. Knowledge, gone to worm-belly.</line>
    <line>Only vengeance remains. If you would avenge my loss, ask me how you might slay the worms.</line>

    <line>The cold is their shroud. It numbs, it preserves, it kills. I’ve learned to love and hate the cold equally.</line>

  <entry keyword="burrow">
    <line>Follow a fresh burrow and you’ll find trouble—or a quick death. Ice worms rarely travel alone.</line>
    <line>Burrows collapse after the worms pass, sealing secrets and corpses alike.</line>

  <entry keyword="fang">
    <line>Their fangs are sharp as icicles and twice as deadly. I keep one as a reminder.</line>

    <line>Their eggs are rare, hidden in pockets of blue ice. I found one once, and fled before it hatched.</line>
    <line>Omelets are off the menu when you study ice worms.</line>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>The ice worms make music as they tunnel—rumbling, resonant, and deeply unsettling.</line>
    <line>Some claim to hear melodies in the glacier at night. I only hear warnings.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Fire is the only defense against the worms. A torch at your side, always.</line>
    <line>They fear fire as much as I fear their cold. A rare balance.</line>

<trait name="Wolf Naturalist" priority="40">
  <!-- Step 1: Job -->
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>My vocation? I study, document, and, when forced, hunt the grey wolves that haunt these wilds.</line>
    <line>Some call me a naturalist, others a madman. Both are true. Wolves are my life's obsession—my pride, my torment.</line>
    <line>I keep notes on every howl and pawprint. Ask me about wolves, if you’re bold—or foolish—enough.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Step 2: Wolves -->
  <entry keyword="wolf">
    <line>Grey wolves are noble—cunning, strong, endlessly misunderstood. Yet they are also thieves and killers, by necessity and by nature.</line>
    <line>I've followed wolf packs for years. Their discipline is unmatched. Their cruelty, legendary.</line>
    <line>If you wish to know the grey wolf’s secret, ask about their pack. It's the heart of everything.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Step 3: Pack -->
  <entry keyword="pack">
    <line>A wolf without its pack is nothing—a ghost among trees. In numbers, they are a force of nature.</line>
    <line>Each pack is led by an alpha. But every member is vital. Their coordination is terrifying to witness.</line>
    <line>Once, I saw a pack bring down a stag twice their size. If you want to understand their ways, ask about their hunting.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Step 4: Hunting -->
  <entry keyword="hunting">
    <line>The hunt is the grey wolf's art—silent, swift, ruthless. Nothing escapes them for long.</line>
    <line>I’ve watched them for hours—how they fan out, how they circle. It's as much dance as slaughter.</line>
    <line>But their hunting has cost me dearly. If you wish to know why, ask about my sheep.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Step 5: Sheep -->
  <entry keyword="sheep">
    <line>My flock was everything to me. Years of work—gone in a single moonless night.</line>
    <line>Wolves are clever, patient. They waited until I was away—then tore through the fold like shadows.</line>
    <line>I buried every last sheep. If you can stomach it, ask me about revenge.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Step 6: Revenge -->
  <entry keyword="revenge">
    <line>Revenge is all I have left. Will you help me bring balance? If you are ready to take the hunt, say ‘hunt’.</line>
    <line>The wolves took my peace, my livelihood. I must answer blood with blood. Will you hunt them?</line>

    <line>Hellsteeds are forged by unholy pacts—desperate riders trading souls for power, unleashing chaos upon the land.</line>
    <line>Each Hellsteed carries the mark of a broken bargain, its eyes burning with regret—and hunger.</line>
    <line>But even a pact leaves a weakness. If you’re brave, ask about their bridle.</line>

    <line>The High Plains Boura is king of mischief: tusks like plows, hide like iron, and a glint of mischief in every eye.</line>

  <entry keyword="harvest">
    <line>I once tended a prize-winning pumpkin patch—the envy of the region. That was before the boura rampage of ’08.</line>
    <line>In a single night, they trampled my dreams to pulp. I awoke to devastation and a single, muddy hoofprint as a calling card.</line>
    <line>Their appetite is legend, their cunning unmatched. If only I’d heeded the warning signs—ask me about footprints.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="footprints">
    <line>A boura’s footprint is wide and deep, edged with three cruel claws. To see fresh tracks is to know your peace is ending.</line>
    <line>I mapped their trails for seasons, hoping to outsmart them. Instead, they outsmarted me.</line>
    <line>They left a trail right to my front door. Ask me about their tactics, if you dare.</line>

    <line>Boura tusks can uproot a tree—or your patience. I once tried to carve one. It snapped my best knife.</line>
    <line>A fence is nothing to a boura’s tusk. Nothing, I tell you.</line>

  <entry keyword="hide">
    <line>Boura hide is tough enough to turn blades and break hearts. Some try to tan it for armor; most give up.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="herd">
    <line>A lone boura is trouble; a herd is catastrophe. I’ve seen a dozen flatten an orchard in an hour.</line>

  <entry keyword="chew">
    <line>Boura chew everything—roots, fences, even my hat once. They have no respect for property or dignity.</line>
    <line>I once watched a boura chew through a locked gate. Still don’t know how it did it.</line>

    <line>The moon was high the night of my ruin. I blame it as much as the boura.</line>

    <line>During a stampede, even the bravest flee. The boura never do.</line>

    <line>Boura love a good wallow—mud, water, anything foul. My well was never the same after their visit.</line>
    <line>They say a wallowing boura brings rain. I say it brings mud and misery.</line>

  <entry keyword="tail">
    <line>A boura’s tail swishes when it’s plotting. Watch the tail; it tells you what’s coming.</line>
    <line>I once tied a bell to a boura’s tail. It noticed, and so did I—when it charged me.</line>

  <entry keyword="quill">
    <line>Some boura sport quills—nature’s way of saying “keep your distance.” I keep a few for luck. Or to remind me of my luck.</line>
    <line>Quills in the foot are a pain I wish on no one, not even a boura.</line>

    <line>The boura stamp their authority on every inch of the plains—and on every gardener’s patience.</line>
    <line>My stamp collection once included rare coins. Now it’s mostly hoofprints.</line>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>Boura sleep like logs—until you’re near, then they’re up and charging. No rest for the weary, or the wise.</line>
    <line>I envy a boura’s sleep. Nothing troubles their dreams.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="herb">
    <line>Some say boura are drawn to rare herbs. I say they’re drawn to anything you value.</line>
    <line>Once, I tried to distract them with a patch of wild sage. They trampled it and ate my beans instead.</line>

    <line>Boura horns curl like fate—hard to predict and even harder to avoid.</line>
    <line>I keep a horn on my mantle as a reminder: nature takes back what it wants.</line>

    <line>Grazing is too gentle a word for what boura do. “Devour” is more accurate.</line>

    <line>Serpents are many, but the Ice Serpent is a breed apart—cold-blooded in every sense.</line>
    <line>Long, sinuous, and white as death. Their fangs gleam like icicles. Ask about their habitat if you care to shiver.</line>

  <entry keyword="insanity">
    <line>Their insanity is a sickness, creeping like ivy. It warps their minds, drives them to fury.</line>
    <line>Some blame tainted sap. Others, curses from unkind gods. I blame the grove—ask about the grove, if you dare.</line>
    <line>Their insanity is not mere madness. It is a hunger, a longing for what once was. The grove holds their secrets.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grove">
    <line>The grove is sacred and profane—a heart once pure, now rotten at its roots.</line>
    <line>They say a great sorrow befell the grove. Now it breeds only rage. Ask me about sorrow, and I’ll tell you more.</line>
    <line>I have walked the grove’s edge. Heard the dryads weep. Their sorrow is poison in the soil.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sorrow">
    <line>The sorrow began with a theft—a relic stolen from the grove, leaving only grief behind.</line>
    <line>I know the relic: the Heartwood Lyre. Its absence drives the dryads wild. Speak to me of the lyre, and the truth is yours.</line>
    <line>Every mad dryad mourns the lyre. The song is broken, their sanity with it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lyre">
    <line>The Heartwood Lyre soothed the groves, binding dryad and forest together.</line>

    <line>You want to know what I do? I observe, catalog, and—occasionally—flee from the Interred Grizzle.</line>
    <line>Some call me a lunatic, others a scholar. The truth? I am the world’s foremost InterredGrizzle enthusiast and adversary.</line>
    <line>I’ve spent decades charting every grisly habit of that abominable beast. Ask me about InterredGrizzle, if your nerves allow.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="InterredGrizzle">
    <line>Ah, the Interred Grizzle: crypt-borne terror, tomb’s mistake, and my greatest fascination.</line>
    <line>Few have seen its bone-white claws and lived to sketch them. Fewer still wish to remember.</line>
    <line>You wish to know more? Ask me about its lair. Only then does its horror make sense.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="lair">
    <line>The lair—dark, fetid, echoing with gnawing and regret. Beneath the old mausoleum, where the sun never remembers to shine.</line>
    <line>It’s a catacomb of misery. Bones line the walls; secrets lurk in every shadow.</line>
    <line>But a lair is nothing without its feeding. Ask what it eats—if your stomach is sturdy.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="feeding">
    <line>Feeding is a ritual. InterredGrizzle devours marrow and memory alike, feasting on the bones of heroes and the hopes of grave-robbers.</line>
    <line>Once, I watched it gnaw a coffin like a dog with a bone—except the bone was singing.</line>
    <line>But its hunger is born from loss. Ask about its sorrow, if you can bear it.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="sorrow">
    <line>Sorrow is the monster’s shadow. They say InterredGrizzle was once human, a guardian who failed his charge and was cursed to hunger eternally.</line>
    <line>Its cries are the echoes of ancient regrets. Sometimes, in the stillness, you can hear it weeping.</line>
    <line>But my hatred is personal. Ask me why I despise it above all others.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="despise">
    <line>Why do I despise the InterredGrizzle? Because it devoured the only friend I ever had—a grave-digger named Thomlin, who brought me stories and stale bread.</line>
    <line>I vowed revenge the night I found Thomlin’s hat, gnawed and bloodied, beside the mausoleum door.</line>
    <line>My purpose is clear. Will you help me put the beast to rest? Say ‘end it’ if you have the courage.</line>

    <line>The old mausoleum was once a place of dignity. Now, only echoes and dust remain.</line>
    <line>I would not enter there after midnight, not for all the gold in Britannia.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>I have seen that shadow eat candlelight. I’ve not slept since.</line>

  <entry keyword="regret">
    <line>Regret is a heavy cloak. The InterredGrizzle wears it better than any.</line>

  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="grave">
    <line>Every grave is a door. Some doors should stay closed.</line>
    <line>The InterredGrizzle is both the lock and the key, if you follow.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>Legends say it once protected the dead, not devoured them.</line>
    <line>A twisted fate: from watchman to wretch. I pity it, sometimes.</line>

    <line>Some try to break the curse. Most simply break.</line>

    <line>They say the InterredGrizzle devours memory, not flesh. But my scars remember.</line>
    <line>I tried forgetting once. The beast reminded me.</line>

  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="crypt">
    <line>Crypts are silent libraries of tragedy. Some monsters read them with their teeth.</line>
    <line>I mapped every crypt beneath this town, searching for answers. Found only more questions.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="howl">
    <line>At midnight, the InterredGrizzle howls. Not for the living, but for the peace it cannot find.</line>
    <line>I would rather hear a banshee than that mournful howl.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="key">
    <line>The only key I ever found in a crypt was made of bone. It didn’t unlock any doors—just nightmares.</line>
    <line>Keys and secrets go hand in hand, until a monster chews them both.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="cloak">
    <line>I wore a black cloak once. The beast shredded it, and nearly me with it.</line>
    <line>Now I wear only daylight and hope.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="bread">
    <line>Thomlin swore grave-digging made bread taste sweeter. I think it just made him hungrier.</line>
    <line>I still carry a crust, in memory. Rats don’t touch it. Even they know grief.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="door">
    <line>Some doors should never be opened. Others open themselves at the worst time.</line>
    <line>The InterredGrizzle is a master of doors. Locked, barred, blessed—none matter.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="weeping">
    <line>Weeping in the crypts means you’re still alive—or you wish you weren’t.</line>
    <line>The InterredGrizzle weeps for what it cannot remember.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="fragment">
    <line>The bone fragment is all that remains when the beast is ended—a shard of its curse.</line>
    <line>Keep it close, and dreams will come. Not the pleasant sort.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="shard">
    <line>Shards of the past litter my dreams and my pockets.</line>
    <line>If you find a bone shard, don’t keep it. Give it to the earth, not your pillow.</line>

    <line>Celebrate quietly. Loud joy draws shadows.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="peace">
    <line>Peace is what I seek. Not for me, but for those the beast torments.</line>
    <line>Some say peace is the absence of monsters. I say it’s the presence of friends.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="token">
    <line>Bring a token of victory, not a trophy. The beast deserves respect, even in death.</line>
    <line>A true token is a story, not a bone.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="rest">
    <line>Thomlin deserves to rest. So do I. So does the InterredGrizzle, if truth be told.</line>
    <line>Rest is for the untroubled. I envy them.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="dawn">
    <line>Dawn is the only thing that frightens the beast. Sunlight tastes of forgiveness, or so I’m told.</line>

  </entry>

    <line>Silence in a crypt is heavier than any stone.</line>

  <entry keyword="invention">
    <line>I built the “Heart of Steel”—a living engine of gears and hope. The IronBeetles devoured it overnight.</line>
    <line>It was more than a device; it was my life’s work, meant to power the whole village. Now it’s gone.</line>
    <line>Their hunger for metal is endless, but my heart broke with that loss. Ask me about loss if you wish to know my grief.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="loss">
    <line>Loss is the echo in an empty forge. Every hammer blow reminds me of what the beetles took.</line>
    <line>I mourn not just for metal, but for trust in my own workshop. IronBeetles leave scars, not just holes.</line>

    <line>Mountains are the wind’s backbone, the KazeKemono’s stage. I’ve camped on their peaks, listening.</line>
    <line>I left offerings for the wind on the highest crags. The beasts took them—and left teeth marks.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="shard">
    <line>Once I found a sky-blue shard after a storm. Too cold to touch, and gone by morning.</line>
    <line>Some shards sing in the wind. Most just cut your fingers.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>Not all echoes are your own. Some belong to things with sharper teeth than memory.</line>
    <line>I heard an echo once that never ended. Still waiting for it to come back around.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="tail">
    <line>They say a KazeKemono’s tail can stir up a cyclone. I keep my distance, just in case.</line>
    <line>The only thing wilder than a wind-beast’s mane is its tail.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="fang">
    <line>Their fangs are mist and lightning—deadly, but fleeting. Don’t try to collect them.</line>
    <line>Once, I saw a fang print in a fallen tree, charred and still smoking.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="mist">
    <line>Some wind-beasts dissolve into mist when threatened. I wish my experiments could do the same.</line>
    <line>Walking in the mist, you sometimes see shapes—some best left unseen.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="season">
    <line>Spring brings tempests, and the KazeKemono with them. My roof barely survives.</line>
    <line>Every season has its wind, and every wind its beast. It’s a busy calendar.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="silence">
    <line>Silence before a storm is the KazeKemono’s favorite prank. Don’t trust the quiet.</line>
    <line>I crave silence, but the wind is never truly still—not while they roam.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="rain">
    <line>Rain follows in their wake, drenching everything I own. Paperwork included.</line>
    <line>Some say the beasts weep rain. I say they’re just sloppy eaters.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="track">
    <line>Tracking wind-beasts is hard—they leave no prints, only swirling grass and startled birds.</line>
    <line>I keep a logbook, but the pages turn themselves on windy days.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>Never look a wind-beast in the eye. Their gaze is as cold as high-altitude air.</line>
    <line>The eye of the storm is safest, they say. I say: define safe.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="beacon">
    <line>I tried to lure them with a beacon of light. All I caught was a very angry goose.</line>
    <line>Sky beacons attract more than KazeKemono—sometimes, unwanted visitors arrive.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="banner">
    <line>I once raised a banner to track the wind’s direction. The KazeKemono shredded it in an hour.</line>
    <line>Banners flutter, but wind-beasts fly. There’s a lesson there, somewhere.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="compass">
    <line>My compass spins wildly whenever a KazeKemono is near. Useless for navigation, perfect for warning.</line>
    <line>Wind and compass are old enemies. I side with the wind, usually.</line>

  <!-- Step 1: The Hook -->
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>My job? Ha! I am the city’s foremost Kepetch expert—an honor and a curse.</line>
    <line>I study, document, and—regrettably—hunt Kepetch wherever they scuttle.</line>
    <line>Kepetch are the bane of my existence and the center of my research. Ask about Kepetch if you must.</line>

  <!-- Step 2: The Obsession -->
  <entry keyword="kepetch">
    <line>Kepetch: skittering nightmares, six-legged thieves, architects of chaos beneath our feet.</line>
    <line>Some fear spiders or snakes. I have studied Kepetch for decades and found only new reasons to despise them.</line>
    <line>I would have made peace—if not for what they stole from me. Ask what they took, if you wish to know true bitterness.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <!-- Step 3: The Motive -->
  <entry keyword="stole">
    <line>They stole my father’s map, the one he charted through the ancient tunnels. Priceless, irreplaceable.</line>
    <line>While I catalogued their nest, a bold Kepetch slipped from the shadows, snatched the map, and vanished below.</line>
    <line>All my life’s work—lost to those greedy pincers. If you care, ask about the tunnels.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <!-- Step 4: The Lair -->
  <entry keyword="tunnels">
    <line>The old tunnels sprawl beneath the city—a labyrinth where Kepetch rule unchallenged.</line>
    <line>They dig, expand, and weave their empire in darkness. No lantern can keep them at bay for long.</line>
    <line>I dare not descend alone. Only the brave survive below. If you’re bold, ask about their lair.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <!-- Step 5: The Challenge -->
  <entry keyword="lair">
    <line>The lair is a nest of horror—chittering walls, crawling shadows, the constant scrape of pincers on stone.</line>
    <line>Few return with their minds intact, and fewer with their limbs. But my revenge waits in the heart of that lair.</line>
    <line>If vengeance tempts you, ask me how you might help rid us of Kepetch.</line>

    <line>I was once a respected scholar, now they call me obsessed—just because my nightmares crawl on six legs.</line>
    <line>The study of Kepetch is thankless, dangerous, and utterly necessary.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="map">
    <line>The map was my father’s legacy—every twist of the tunnels drawn by hand.</line>
    <line>I sometimes dream I’ll find the map, but it’s surely shredded in some nest.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="father">
    <line>My father vanished in the tunnels, chasing knowledge and shadowy shapes.</line>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Kepetch love the shadows. If you see one move without a source, beware.</line>
    <line>Shadows flicker where Kepetch gather. Their eyes reflect candlelight like polished stones.</line>

    <line>When you hear scuttling, it’s already too late.</line>

    <line>Each nest is a palace of refuse—bones, cloth, stolen silver, and always, always more Kepetch.</line>
    <line>I once counted seven nests in a single vault. Still have the scars.</line>

  <entry keyword="silk">
    <line>Kepetch silk is strong as steel and twice as sticky. Some fools try to harvest it.</line>

    <line>They scrape markings on the walls—a language we have yet to decipher.</line>

    <line>The deeper the burrow, the larger the Kepetch. Or so they say.</line>

    <line>A Kepetch feast is a grisly sight—bones picked clean in minutes.</line>
    <line>I have seen them feast on a fallen rat twice their size.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="shell">
    <line>Kepetch shells are mottled, tough, and nearly impossible to crush.</line>
    <line>Some jewelers pay well for intact shells, though I can’t imagine why.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>The tunnels whisper at night. Some say it’s the wind, others say Kepetch claws.</line>

  <entry keyword="music">

  <entry keyword="revenant">
    <line>Khaldun Revenants—restless, hollow, yet too aware. I both loathe and envy them.</line>

    <line>Some say revenge is hollow. I say it’s the only thing more relentless than a revenant’s hatred.</line>

    <line>I keep a dagger blessed by three priests. It trembles in Khaldun, as if eager to flee.</line>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>A mirror will not show you a Revenant. It will only crack and weep.</line>

    <line>There’s a song the Revenants hum, low and tuneless. If you hear it, cover your ears and pray.</line>
    <line>My brother was a singer once. Now, I fear he hums that same hollow tune.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wine">
    <line>I drank wine to forget the Revenants. It never worked; nightmares are immune to spirits.</line>

    <line>My profession? I am the world’s foremost scholar—and nemesis—of the dreaded Kraken.</line>
    <line>Some call me a sea-myth chaser. I call myself a survivor with a vendetta. Ask about Krakens if you have the spine.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="kraken">
    <line>The Kraken—legend made flesh, with arms long enough to pull down hope itself.</line>
    <line>Most fear storms, I fear tentacles rising from the deep. The Kraken is nature’s nightmare.</line>
    <line>To truly loathe something, you must first appreciate its cunning. Ask about tentacles or perhaps their appetite.</line>

  <entry keyword="tentacle">
    <line>Each Kraken has eight tentacles—each with a mind of its own. They write their own cruel stories in the salt and spray.</line>
    <line>Their grip can crush a ship or cradle a sailor—before dragging both to the abyss.</line>

    <line>No beast hungers as the Kraken does. They devour whales, wood, and the dreams of sailors.</line>

    <line>Pearls—priceless to us, irresistible to Krakens. Their eyes burn for the luster of the sea’s heart.</line>

    <line>My profession? Lava elemental observation—a calling both scorching and sublime.</line>
    <line>I study, document, and sometimes curse those molten beasts.</line>
    <line>To truly understand lava, one must stand at the edge of an eruption. Ask me about lava.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lava">
    <line>Lava flows with purpose, a molten river of will and fury. Within it, elementals are born.</line>
    <line>I have gazed into the fiery eyes of a lava elemental and lived to tell it. Eruption follows wherever they roam.</line>
    <line>Lava is beautiful and brutal—especially when stirred by an elemental. The last eruption cost me dearly. Ask about the eruption, if you wish.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eruption">
    <line>The last eruption was no accident. The elementals led it, guiding molten rivers with gleeful malice.</line>
    <line>My home stood in their path. My collection, a lifetime’s work—reduced to bubbling slag.</line>
    <line>I’ve tried to rebuild, but all I find is molten glass. My collection was legendary. Ask me what was in it—my collection.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="collection">
    <line>Rare minerals, crystals, and stones—my collection was the envy of geologists and thieves alike.</line>
    <line>I spent decades gathering them, each specimen unique, each with a story. Now, all lost to fire.</line>
    <line>Some minerals were irreplaceable. There’s one that haunts me most. Ask about my mineral, and I’ll tell you of loss.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mineral">
    <line>Obsidian prism, flawless and pure—a once-in-a-generation find. The lava elementals melted it as if it were sugar.</line>
    <line>It was more than a rock. It was my legacy, my pride. Now it’s gone, and only revenge remains.</line>
    <line>The elementals stole everything from me. Only their destruction can soothe the wound. Speak of revenge, and I’ll make you my champion.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="revenge">
    <line>Revenge is all I have left. Will you bring justice to the molten fiends? Ask how to slay them, and I’ll arm you for the task.</line>
    <line>They took what I loved. The scales must balance. Say ‘slay’, if you’re ready to face the flames.</line>
    <line>My vengeance requires a hero’s hand. Say ‘slay’ and earn my eternal gratitude.</line>

    <line>It took me months to rid my bed of ash. I’m still finding it in my boots.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="volcano">
    <line>Volcanoes are the elementals’ playground—never trust a mountain that rumbles in its sleep.</line>
    <line>I used to chart volcanoes for fun. Now, I give them a wide berth.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="heat">
    <line>The heat from a lava elemental can scorch the soul, not just the skin.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Fire is nature’s painter, and elementals its wildest artists.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="obsidian">

    <line>I once had a dagger of pure obsidian. It melted in the eruption.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="crystal">
    <line>Crystals refract light, revealing hidden colors. My favorite was the fire opal—now, just a memory.</line>
    <line>A lava elemental cares little for beauty. Crystals are just more fuel.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="earth">
    <line>The earth groans before an eruption. Listen carefully, and you might live.</line>
    <line>Earth and fire are ancient enemies. I chose the losing side, it seems.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glow">
    <line>Lava elementals glow like embers in the dark. I used to find it mesmerizing—before I learned to fear it.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="forge">
    <line>Forgemasters envy the heat a lava elemental can summon. Some even try to capture it. Fools.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="core">
    <line>They say the planet’s core is pure fire, and that’s where the oldest elementals dwell.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pyromancer">
    <line>Pyromancers fancy themselves masters of fire. They’ve never met a true elemental.</line>
    <line>I studied with a pyromancer once. She left after the eruption—couldn’t take the heat.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="magma">
    <line>Magma is lava’s shadow—hidden, powerful, waiting to break free.</line>
    <line>Lava elementals swim in magma like fish in a pond. Terrifying, if you think about it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ruin">
    <line>Ruin follows lava, as night follows sunset.</line>
    <line>They say ruins hold secrets, but all I found was melted stone and old regrets.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gem">
    <line>Gems are born of pressure and time. Lava destroys in seconds what nature builds in ages.</line>
    <line>I lost a sapphire in that eruption—melted into oblivion.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scorch">
    <line>My hands bear scorch marks from the day I tried to save my minerals. Foolish, perhaps.</line>
    <line>Scorch marks are all that remain of my old maps.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dust">
    <line>Everything ends as dust, they say. Lava simply hurries the process along.</line>
    <line>I swept volcanic dust from my shelves for years. Never could keep up.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="statue">
    <line>I once had a statue carved from basalt. The elementals found it amusing to melt it into a puddle.</line>
    <line>Basalt makes a poor shield against lava, trust me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smith">
    <line>Every smith in town envies the heat of lava. Only a fool tries to harness it directly.</line>
    <line>I watched a smith’s anvil glow red from the eruption. He never forged again.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="basalt">
    <line>Basalt is sturdy, but not sturdy enough—not when lava is hungry.</line>
    <line>I built my display shelves from basalt. They didn’t last the night.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fear">
    <line>Some say fear is weakness. I say it’s wisdom, learned the hard way.</line>
    <line>Even now, I jump at the sound of bubbling water.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rescue">
    <line>I tried to rescue my collection, but the heat drove me back.</line>
    <line>Sometimes, there’s nothing left to rescue. Only memories and molten stone.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ember">
    <line>Embers linger long after the fire dies. They whisper warnings, if you listen.</line>
    <line>An elemental’s heart is said to be a living ember. I don’t care to find out firsthand.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glass">
    <line>The eruption fused my collection into twisted glass sculptures. Unintended art, I suppose.</line>
    <line>Some pay fortunes for volcanic glass. I’d give anything to have my old stones instead.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="stone">
    <line>Stone crumbles before the fury of lava. I learned that lesson well.</line>
    <line>I once believed stone was eternal—then came the eruption.</line>

    <line>What do I do? I chronicle, stalk, and—out of grim necessity—battle the infamous lava lizards.</line>
    <line>Some call me a scholar, others a fool, but I know them better than anyone living. Ask me about lizards, if you’re curious.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lizard">
    <line>Lava lizards: armored, cunning, with eyes like burning coals. They thrive where most creatures would perish.</line>
    <line>Ordinary lizards bask in the sun. Lava lizards bask in molten stone. Ask me about their habitat if you have a taste for the dangerous.</line>

  <entry keyword="habitat">
    <line>Their true home is deep in the volcanic caverns—pools of lava, rivers of heat.</line>

  <entry keyword="egg">
    <line>Lava lizard eggs are coveted for their warmth and rare alchemical uses. I once guarded a clutch... until disaster struck.</line>
    <line>The eggs glow in the dark like lanterns, but hatch into chaos. The theft of an egg changed my life forever. Ask me about the theft if you dare.</line>
    <line>A single egg can start a fire, or end a friendship. It was the theft of an egg that doomed me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="theft">
    <line>The theft happened years ago—a rival scholar stole the egg I was sworn to protect. In their greed, they unleashed havoc.</line>
    <line>The day of the theft, my reputation was incinerated, and the lizards’ wrath fell upon me. Ask about wrath, if you wish to hear my tale.</line>
    <line>The thief vanished, but the lizards never forgot. Their fury was as hot as their breath. The wrath that followed changed me.</line>

  <entry keyword="wrath">

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="storm">
    <line>Storms come and go, but the Leviathan rides beneath, drawn by thunder as if it were song.</line>
    <line>I once saw a storm swirl in the beast’s wake. Never again did I trust calm waters.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shark">
    <line>Sharks are wolves of the waves—fearsome, but not hateful. Leviathan eats sharks for breakfast.</line>
    <line>I once saw a shark bite Leviathan’s fin. I never saw that shark again.</line>

  <entry keyword="tentacle">
    <line>Tentacles? You’re thinking of krakens. Leviathan’s strength is in its jaws and scale, not arms.</line>
    <line>Even krakens give Leviathan wide berth. The tentacled ones know fear, too.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="map">
    <line>Maps are useless where the sea shifts and churns. Leviathan carves its own paths in the deep.</line>
    <line>I burned my last map after meeting the beast. Some things should not be found twice.</line>

    <line>Once, I called myself captain. The sea and Leviathan cured me of such pride.</line>

    <line>Some say the Leviathan sings to the deep. If you hear its song, it’s already too late.</line>
    <line>My nightmares echo with a whale’s lament, but it’s Leviathan’s song that wakes me screaming.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="treasure">
    <line>Many hunt for treasure, few return. The real treasure is surviving Leviathan’s attention.</line>

  <entry keyword="fisherman">
    <line>Fishermen tell tales of big catches. None speak of the ones who never return—swallowed whole.</line>
    <line>Every coastal town has a day when the boats vanish. Some whisper Leviathan’s name.</line>

  <entry keyword="scale">
    <line>I found a Leviathan scale once, big as a shield. Too heavy to carry—too cursed to keep.</line>

    <line>The deeper you go, the stranger the world. Leviathan is king of the depths—and master of fear.</line>

    <line>An anchor is useless when the sea itself wishes you gone.</line>

  <entry keyword="nightmare">
    <line>My nightmares are waterlogged and endless. Leviathan is always waiting just beneath the surface.</line>
    <line>Nightmares end at dawn. The Leviathan hunts by day or night—makes no difference to it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bait">
    <line>What bait lures a sea god? Only the desperate or the damned try to find out.</line>
    <line>I’ve lost more bait than I care to remember. The beast is choosy—picks its prey.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="jaw">
    <line>Leviathan’s jaws could swallow a longship whole. I saw it once—still hear the timbers cracking.</line>
    <line>There’s no running from those jaws. Only prayer and panic.</line>

  <entry keyword="echo">

    <line>I saw a fin cut the water like a dagger. Then the whole sea rose. I’ve never felt smaller.</line>

    <line>Liches are not merely skeletons in robes. They are the pinnacle—and perversion—of necromancy.</line>
    <line>The lich craves eternity but loses everything human. To understand them, you must know about their phylacteries.</line>

  <entry keyword="phylactery">
    <line>The phylactery—a cursed vessel. Inside, the lich binds its very soul. Destroy it, and you destroy the lich.</line>
    <line>I spent years studying phylacteries. Each lich guards theirs with an obsession. Ask me about obsessions, if you dare.</line>

    <line>Some liches hoard relics, others memories. Mine, though—he covets reflections. Ask me about mirrors, if you must.</line>
    <line>Mirrors are more than glass to my foe—they are portals, trophies, reminders of what he’s lost. Ask about mirrors.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>My life’s tragedy was wrought in silvered glass. The lich king stole my soul’s reflection in a mirror—left me a shadow.</line>
    <line>He believed mirrors would restore his lost humanity. Instead, they steal fragments of other souls. Ask about souls.</line>
    <line>Shattered glass, fractured souls. The lich king collects both. If you wish to help me, ask about revenge.</line>

  <entry keyword="soul">
    <line>A soul, once reflected and stolen, cannot be mended—unless the thief is destroyed. Only then will I be whole.</line>
    <line>Every night, I feel the emptiness inside—the part stolen by that monster. My only solace is the thought of revenge.</line>

    <line>I sometimes wonder if the moon is just another cursed mirror.</line>

    <line>Owl’s eyes are wise, but never trust their silence.</line>

    <line>Too much dust means something has lain undisturbed—and possibly undead.</line>
    <line>The scent of old dust often means a lich is near.</line>

    <line>Some seek gold, others glory. I seek understanding… and vengeance. Ask me about lizardmen, if you’re brave.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="village">
    <line>The lizardman village lies deep in the marsh, shrouded by mist and frogsong. Few outsiders have seen it and left whole.</line>
    <line>They build with mud, bone, and dreams of conquest. I lost much there… perhaps you’ll ask about my collection?</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="collection">
    <line>I once had a collection: ancient statuettes, relics of a vanished civilization. Lizardmen covet such things above all else.</line>

    <line>If you wish to know what drives my enmity, ask me about the idol.</line>

  <entry keyword="idol">
    <line>The idol of Naxxil: carved from obsidian, revered by the lizardmen as a symbol of power. It was my prize—and their obsession.</line>
    <line>They stole it in the night, hissing curses and promises. My life’s study, taken by cold hands. If you seek justice, ask me about revenge.</line>
    <line>The idol is gone, but the wound festers. My only comfort is the thought of revenge.</line>

    <line>Lizardman scales shimmer in the moonlight—beautiful, until you realize each one is sharp as a dagger.</line>
    <line>They shed their scales in spring. I once tried to keep one as a bookmark. The book dissolved in slime.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="swamp">
    <line>The swamp is their sanctuary—mists, biting insects, roots to trip the unwary.</line>
    <line>Only fools rush into the marshes. Lizardmen know every shadow, every hiding place.</line>

  <entry keyword="tongue">
    <line>Their tongues flicker, tasting the air for secrets. Beware when it darts your way—it means they’re watching.</line>

    <line>Lizardmen love shiny things—coins, gems, polished bones. More magpie than monster, in some ways.</line>
    <line>If something glitters in the swamp, assume it’s a trap or a lizardman’s prize.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>Lizardmen play haunting music on bone flutes and hollow reeds. It echoes for miles in the mist.</line>
    <line>Their songs are half-memory, half-threat. Listen too closely, and you may forget your own name.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fangs">
    <line>Their fangs gleam like ivory. A smile from a lizardman is never friendly.</line>
    <line>Fangs for biting, fangs for display. Both mean trouble.</line>

    <line>Fish are sacred and staple. Never take a fish from a lizardman net unless you want war.</line>
    <line>I once swapped a fish for information. Both proved slippery.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shield">
    <line>Their shields are woven from reeds and scales. Surprisingly strong, surprisingly light.</line>
    <line>A lizardman never parts with a shield willingly. I have the bruises to prove it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>Boura do not sing, thank the heavens. Their snorting is music enough.</line>

  <entry keyword="marsh">
    <line>Marshes are prime boura territory. Bring extra socks and a sense of humor.</line>

    <line>I nearly drowned chasing a boura through the marsh. It watched, unconcerned, then wandered off.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="enemy">
    <line>To a boura, everything is either food, mud, or an enemy. Sometimes all three at once.</line>
    <line>I once thought of myself as their friend. The boura quickly set me straight.</line>

    <line>My occupation? I am a birdwatcher by trade—an unwilling macaw expert by necessity.</line>

    <line>Macaws: dazzling feathers, shrill voices, sharper minds. Most see beauty—I see ruin.</line>
    <line>They’re clever, charming, and utterly devious. Few know their true nature. If you must, ask me about their mischief.</line>
    <line>Those birds are chaos in flight. Colorful, yes—dangerous, more so. Curious about their habits?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mischief">
    <line>Macaws are pranksters with wings. They raid picnics, pilfer jewels, and mimic your darkest secrets.</line>
    <line>Once, I caught a macaw unlocking my cottage window. Their talent for mischief is unmatched. Their favorite? Stealing keys.</line>
    <line>It was a stolen key that ended my peace. Want to know the story? Ask about the key.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="key">
    <line>It was my grandfather’s key—ancient, ornate, and the only way to open our family chest.</line>
    <line>A macaw snatched it midair, laughing with every beat of its wings. The chest? Never opened since.</line>
    <line>The loss haunts me. My inheritance, locked away, all because of a feathered thief. If you want to know what was lost, ask about the chest.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chest">
    <line>The chest contained heirlooms, journals, even a map to a lost orchard. All memories, all gone.</line>
    <line>I searched for years. All I found were macaw feathers and the echoes of laughter in the trees.</line>
    <line>Now I seek justice, not just for myself, but for all macaw victims. Will you help me? Ask how you might aid my revenge.</line>

    <line>A macaw’s plume is vivid as a sunset—too bright to trust, in my opinion.</line>
    <line>People covet their plumes. I say, beware what shines too brightly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="banana">
    <line>Macaws prefer nuts and fruit, but bananas? They’ll use them to draw rude faces in the mud.</line>
    <line>I lost a whole bunch of bananas once. They returned… squashed and painted.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="jewel">
    <line>Never wear jewels in the forest. Macaws think them invitations to a game of hide-and-seek.</line>
    <line>They say a local lord’s signet ring still hangs from a nest, glittering in the sun.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>Some birds sing. Macaws perform. Their song is an orchestra—if you like chaos and shrieking.</line>
    <line>At dawn, the forest is theirs. No man can sleep through their chorus.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tree">
    <line>Macaws nest high in the canopy—far above our worries, plotting their next outrage.</line>
    <line>I’ve climbed many trees searching for their nests. Only once did I find something other than feathers and laughter.</line>
  </entry>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feather">
    <line>I have a collection of macaw feathers—each one a trophy, each one a reminder of what I’ve lost.</line>
    <line>Beware: their feathers are sometimes cursed. Or so I’ve heard from a local witch.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="witch">
    <line>The village witch claims macaws are spies for forest spirits. I think they just like her shiny cauldron.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fruit">
    <line>Fruit vendors hate macaws. Their stalls are raided with military precision.</line>
    <line>I once saw a macaw throw guavas at a dog until it fled. Strategic, they are.</line>

    <line>I suspect they delight in chaos—weather included.</line>

  <entry keyword="color">
    <line>Never trust something so brightly colored. It’s nature’s warning.</line>
    <line>Macaws wear their colors like a dare—go on, try to catch me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>A mirror attracts a macaw like honey attracts bees. They’ll peck at their own reflection for hours.</line>
    <line>I lost a hand mirror to one once. Saw it dangling from a nest for months.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mimic">
    <line>Macaws mimic voices, laughter, even the bark of a dog. Never repeat a secret near one.</line>
    <line>One mimicked my mother’s call so well, I came running. Found only feathers.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>Some keep macaws as pets. They also keep earplugs and a healthy supply of patience.</line>
    <line>My cousin’s pet macaw learned to unlock cages. The chaos was legendary.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="treat">
    <line>Offer a treat and a macaw might come close—but it’ll never thank you, only judge.</line>
    <line>I’ve spent more on treats than on rent, trying to bribe their forgiveness.</line>

    <line>They coil in abandoned places, whispering to the walls. The old asylum is their larder and their lair.</line>

  <entry keyword="asylum">
    <line>The asylum was once a place of healing. Now, its halls echo with the horrors' laughter and the lost memories of its victims.</line>

    <line>If you truly wish to understand my hatred, ask me of my brother.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="brother">
    <line>My brother was a kind soul—a healer who believed every mind could be mended. The Maddening Horror shattered him.</line>

    <line>If you wish to learn more, ask about their horns. There lies the heart of their mystery.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="horn">
    <line>To a minotaur, the horns are symbols—pride, strength, and their dark legacy.</line>
    <line>I lost everything to those horns—my reputation, my friends, and… my brother. Do you wish to know how?</line>
    <line>The horns are trophies and weapons both. But the greatest wound a minotaur ever dealt me was betrayal. Ask me about it.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="betrayal">
    <line>I trusted a minotaur once. A rare, clever beast—I believed I could tame it, teach it peace. I was wrong.</line>
    <line>It betrayed my trust and destroyed what I loved. I swore vengeance—not just against one, but all of its kind.</line>
    <line>Ask me about vengeance, if you’re not afraid of what it costs.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="vengeance">
    <line>Vengeance is all I have left. Ten minotaurs—ten monsters for ten years of regret. Will you help me?</line>

  <entry keyword="maze">
    <line>Not all mazes house minotaurs. Some hide treasure, others only disappointment.</line>
    <line>I once got lost in a hedge maze. Less blood, more sneezing.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="hoof">
    <line>A minotaur’s hoof leaves a crescent print—easier to track than to survive an encounter.</line>
    <line>Their hooves echo for hours in stone corridors. Hard to say if that’s comforting or terrifying.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="beast">
    <line>Many call minotaurs beasts. I call them rivals, adversaries—never mere animals.</line>
    <line>Beasts follow instinct. Minotaurs follow something darker.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>My brother was the brave one. He faced a minotaur and vanished in the maze.</line>
    <line>We speak no more of him. The labyrinth keeps its secrets.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="torch">
    <line>Always carry a torch in a maze. Shadows hide more than monsters.</line>
    <line>My torch once revealed a minotaur sleeping. I turned and ran.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="map">
    <line>I have drawn dozens of maps, none truly accurate. Labyrinths shift, as do memories.</line>
    <line>Maps are comfort for the lost. They rarely save you.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>Minotaurs crave the scent of blood—be it animal, or adventurer.</line>
    <line>Blood stains never wash from maze stones. I’ve tried.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>In the labyrinth, shadows twist and fool the eyes. That’s where minotaurs thrive.</line>
    <line>I learned to fear shadows before I feared minotaurs.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="cheese">
    <line>Cheese? For rats, perhaps. Minotaurs prefer the taste of trespassers.</line>
    <line>I once tried baiting a minotaur with cheese. It only made it angrier.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>Echoes carry secrets in mazes. Listen well, or risk walking in circles.</line>
    <line>I swear, sometimes the minotaurs use echoes to hunt you.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="bone">
    <line>Labyrinths are built on old bones. Some say minotaurs honor the dead. I have my doubts.</line>
    <line>Step on a bone in a maze, and you’ll have company soon.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>There are legends of a minotaur king. If true, he rules from a maze within a maze.</line>
    <line>I hope never to meet such royalty.</line>

  <entry keyword="wine">
    <line>Minotaurs despise wine. Something about the smell. Can’t say I blame them.</line>
    <line>Once, a minotaur destroyed a vineyard out of spite. The villagers never recovered.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="bell">
    <line>In some tales, minotaurs hate the sound of bells. Others say it drives them into a rage.</line>
    <line>I keep a bell handy, just in case. For what, I’m not sure.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="statue">
    <line>Labyrinths are littered with old statues—heroes, monsters, fools.</line>
    <line>I tried hiding behind one once. The minotaur wasn’t fooled.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>Some say minotaurs howl at the full moon. I say that’s wolves, not monsters with horns.</line>
    <line>The moonlight in a labyrinth is always treacherous—shadows leap at you.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="hide">
    <line>Minotaur hide is thick and tough. Some blacksmiths make boots of it—if you dare.</line>
    <line>I wear no trophies. Let others tempt fate.</line>

  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="milk">
    <line>Minotaur milk? That’s a cruel jest. I wouldn’t drink it, if I were you.</line>
    <line>I once met a bard who claimed minotaur milk was magical. He disappeared soon after.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="sword">
    <line>A sword against a minotaur is like a toothpick against a bull—useful, if you’re clever.</line>
    <line>Steel alone won’t save you in a maze.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>I bear many scars, but none from a minotaur. I prefer to keep my distance.</line>
    <line>Scars are reminders—some of foolishness, some of luck.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="treasure">
    <line>Every labyrinth promises treasure. Most only deliver danger.</line>
    <line>Minotaurs hoard little. What they guard is never worth the risk.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>Music soothes many beasts, but not a minotaur. Their ears are attuned to footsteps, not songs.</line>
    <line>Once, a foolish bard tried to serenade a minotaur. The results were… messy.</line>

    <line>I once found my coin purse atop a tree—emptied and gnawed, thanks to their mischief.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="snake">
    <line>Call them snakes, and they’ll gut you for the insult. They are more—much more—than simple serpents.</line>
    <line>Snakes crawl, but Ophidians plot.</line>

  <entry keyword="poison">

    <line>Never drink from a cup left in their nest. Poison is their silent servant.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="prey">

  <entry keyword="curse">
    <line>Some believe the Matriarch’s gaze alone can curse a soul. I do not test the legend.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual dagger">
    <line>The ritual dagger is never far from the Matriarch’s coil. It has tasted more blood than wine.</line>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>Ophidians play no music, save for their rattles and hissing. It is a sound to chill the spine.</line>

    <line>Never trust an Ophidian ally. Their loyalty coils back on itself.</line>
    <line>There are tales of men who bargained with the Matriarch. None tell them twice.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vision">
    <line>The Matriarch’s vision pierces darkness. Some say she sees into your very heart.</line>
    <line>To meet her gaze is to know dread. I prefer to study her from afar.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trap">
    <line>Ophidian traps are elegant and fatal. I have mapped many, survived few.</line>
    <line>Trip a wire in their nest and you will not live to regret it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rain">
    <line>They say the Matriarch calls the rain to flood her enemies’ lairs. It’s superstition—but the storms always come.</line>
    <line>I keep a dry cloak and wary eyes when clouds gather near Ophidian lands.</line>

    <line>One whiff is all the warning you’ll ever need.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>Brutes hoard shiny objects—goblets, buckles, and the occasional goat.</line>
    <line>They value gold, but seem to eat most of it by mistake.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="camp">
    <line>Brute camps are easy to spot: smoke, noise, and broken furniture for miles.</line>
    <line>If you see a tidy camp, you’ve taken a wrong turn.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="leader">
    <line>Orc brutes respect only strength. Their leader is the loudest, angriest, and least likely to live long.</line>

  <entry keyword="trap">
    <line>Brutes aren’t clever, but they’re heavy. Traps that rely on brains won’t work—try a pit instead.</line>

  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>My profession? Chronicler and scourge of the orc captains. Their every blunder, I record. Their every cruelty, I abhor.</line>
    <line>I study orc captains: their tribal wars, their garish banners, their dreadful songs.</line>
    <line>Some call me obsessed, others a nuisance. Ask me about orcs if you truly wish to understand my loathing.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="orc">
    <line>Orcs—loud, brutal, organized in their own hideous way. But the captains? They set the tone for savagery.</line>
    <line>The common orc is dangerous enough, but their captains unite chaos and cruelty. Ask about their captains if your stomach is strong.</line>
    <line>I could write a book on their rank stench alone, but the captains deserve a chapter of their own.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="captain">
    <line>Orc captains are the linchpins of their tribes—larger, meaner, more cunning than their kin.</line>
    <line>I track every captain’s rise and fall. Their scars are stories; their helmets, trophies stolen in war.</line>
    <line>I lost more than my peace to a captain named Gruksh. Ask me of Gruksh, if you dare.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gruksh">
    <line>Gruksh—may his name be spat! He led the raid on my village. My books burned, my family scattered.</line>
    <line>He wore a helm of black iron and spoke in riddles and threats. My life’s work reduced to ash at his command.</line>
    <line>Yet I am no coward. I shadowed Gruksh to his lair. Ask about his lair, if you wish to know true peril.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lair">
    <line>The lair: a cave deep in the blackwood, marked by skulls and stinking fires. Few enter and fewer return.</line>
    <line>Gruksh guards his spoils—books, loot, even my old writing desk—behind orcish traps and loyal guards.</line>
    <line>But every lair has a weakness. Ask about weaknesses, if you would see Gruksh fall.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weakness">
    <line>Orc captains are strong, but pride blinds them. Gruksh mocks any challenger, believing himself invincible.</line>
    <line>If one were bold—and skilled enough—they might slay him and scatter his tribe. Will you accept the challenge? Say ‘slay’ if you are ready.</line>
    <line>I can offer a quest scroll for any brave soul. Utter ‘slay’ and I shall prepare your doom—and his.</line>

    <line>I once tried on an orc helm. The lice haunted me for a month.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="banner">
    <line>Orc banners are daubed with blood and filth. They march behind them, bellowing nonsense.</line>
    <line>Once, I deciphered their symbols—mostly insults and threats. Colorful, in a manner of speaking.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="raid">
    <line>Orc raids are sudden, violent, and rarely well-planned. But their captains improvise with frightening skill.</line>
    <line>If your village is too quiet, check the treeline for green skin and sharp teeth.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="language">
    <line>Orcish language is a collection of curses, threats, and creative insults.</line>
    <line>I speak it poorly—mostly words for surrender or “please stop biting.”</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>Orc songs are less music, more declarations of intent to smash, burn, and eat.</line>
    <line>They sing after victory, before battle, and sometimes during meals. My ears may never recover.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boar">
    <line>Some orc tribes ride boars into battle. The smell is… unforgettable.</line>
    <line>I saw a captain thrown from a boar once. The boar won the argument.</line>

  <entry keyword="tattoo">
    <line>Captains wear tattoos as marks of honor or territory. Some look like maps. Or possibly stew recipes.</line>
    <line>I once tried to copy an orc tattoo for my notes. The ink ate through the page.</line>

    <line>I measured one for my research. Needed two assistants just to lift it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feast">
    <line>Orc feasts are noisy, dangerous, and short on utensils. Never attend as the guest of honor.</line>
    <line>Captains demand the first bite and the last word—usually “more!”</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>Orcs howl at the moon before battle. I’m not sure if it’s tradition or indigestion.</line>

  <entry keyword="chain">
    <line>Captains love chains—wearing them, swinging them, rattling them for effect.</line>
    <line>I tried to study orcish metallurgy. I still can’t get the grime out from under my nails.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mud">
    <line>Mud is both armor and decoration for orcs. Captains use it to mark rank. Or possibly to avoid baths.</line>
    <line>I suspect their greatest enemy is soap.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shaman">
    <line>Every tribe has a shaman—usually old, toothless, and cranky. Captains tolerate them, barely.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen a shaman curse a captain’s boots. He limped for a week.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shield">
    <line>An orc shield is as much for bashing as for blocking. Captains decorate theirs with bones.</line>
    <line>I wouldn’t trust one to stop a thrown pebble, but orcs aren’t picky.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="soup">
    <line>Orc soup is a mystery—ingredients best left unnamed. Captains claim it builds strength. I say it builds regret.</line>
    <line>I sampled it once. Once.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smoke">
    <line>Orc camps always stink of smoke—burning meat, wood, and whatever else they find.</line>
    <line>Hard to tell if it’s for cooking or for hiding the smell of orcs themselves.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bone">
    <line>Bones serve as currency, jewelry, and weapons among orcs. Captains wear the biggest ones as trophies.</line>
    <line>I once mistook a captain’s necklace for soup bones. He didn’t see the humor.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="victory">
    <line>Orc captains celebrate victory with bellowing, chest-beating, and more than a little property damage.</line>
    <line>Once, a captain tried to declare victory before the battle. It didn’t end well for him.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="throne">
    <line>A captain’s throne is rarely more than a big rock or a pile of stolen crates. Still, they sit on it like kings.</line>

  <entry keyword="violin">
    <line>My violin’s music once kept the blight at bay. Ortanord shattered it, silencing hope.</line>

    <line>What do I do? I study, catalog, and—against my will—battle the mysterious moving bandages that plague our land.</line>
    <line>Some call me a healer, others a mad collector. The truth? I am the only expert on Pestilent Bandages, and their most fervent adversary.</line>
    <line>Ask me about bandages, if you wish to learn more. Or if you have a strong stomach.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bandage">
    <line>Bandages, you say? Most are harmless, tools of healing. But some—some twitch and crawl when no one’s looking.</line>
    <line>I have spent years studying bandages: linen, silk, charmed, and—most fearsome—those corrupted by plague.</line>
    <line>Ask about Pestilent Bandages, if you dare. But beware—knowledge may itch worse than the wounds.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pestilent bandage">
    <line>Pestilent Bandages are the nightmares of every healer. Filthy, writhing wrappings, animated by old hospital curses and the hatred of forgotten wounds.</line>
    <line>They once saved lives, now they spread sickness and terror. Some say they whisper secrets in the night.</line>
    <line>If you wish to know how they came to be, ask about the hospital.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hospital">
    <line>It was the old Nightgate Hospital—abandoned, haunted, overflowing with tragedy. I worked there once, tending the dying.</line>
    <line>In those halls, bandages were used again and again, never burned. Disease clung to every fiber, every knot and fold.</line>
    <line>If you would understand my obsession, ask me about infection. That’s where all ruin begins.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="infection">
    <line>Infection—merciless, creeping, unseen. It took my mentor, my friends, and, worst of all, my trust in medicine.</line>
    <line>The Pestilent Bandages are not merely rags—they are the memory of every neglected wound, every fatal mistake.</line>
    <line>What remains for me? Only vengeance. Only the cleansing fire. Ask me about vengeance, if you’re bold enough.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vengeance">
    <line>I seek vengeance for every patient lost, for every sleepless night spent hearing the slither of cursed linen in the dark.</line>
    <line>Will you aid me? Will you rid this town of the crawling remnants of its shame? If you will, say ‘slay’.</line>
    <line>I offer you a task: bring proof of your deed. Utter ‘slay’ if your resolve is firm.</line>

  <entry keyword="mummy">
    <line>People joke that Pestilent Bandages long for a mummy to wrap. Trust me, their ambitions are far more sinister.</line>
    <line>Once, I wrapped a turnip like a mummy to amuse a child. It vanished overnight—never again.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="lint">
    <line>Lint collects in every pocket, but bandage lint is the worst. Sticky, persistent, impossible to banish.</line>
    <line>One patient believed lint was lucky. He did not survive the operation.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="ointment">
    <line>Ointments help wounds, but they are powerless against the animated bandages. I tried. The smell still haunts me.</line>
    <line>I once tried to bribe a Pestilent Bandage with balm. It only grew slicker—and angrier.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="herb">
    <line>Herbs can ward off illness—sometimes. Against the crawling bandages, only steel seems to work.</line>
    <line>My herb sachets vanished from my bedside, replaced by tiny footprints. Linen hates competition, I suppose.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>I wear my scars with pride—reminders of battles fought, lost, and occasionally won against the bandaged menace.</line>
    <line>Every scar has a story. Most involve running faster than I ever thought possible.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="healer">
    <line>Healers are often blamed for curses. I do what I can, but sometimes the wounds bite back.</line>
    <line>The bandages took more than patients. They took hope, too.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="wrap">
    <line>To wrap a wound is to trust the cloth. Now, I trust nothing that doesn’t struggle in my grip.</line>
    <line>Beware loose wrappings at night—they slither when you’re not looking.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="sanctuary">
    <line>I once believed the hospital was a sanctuary. Turns out, sanctuaries make the best lairs for monsters.</line>
    <line>If you seek sanctuary from bandages, keep moving. They hate the restless.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="nurse">
    <line>The nurses were the first to notice the disappearances. Some say they heard laughter from the linen closets.</line>
    <line>I still hear the echo of footsteps—nurses running from their own bandages.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="itch">
    <line>There’s an itch that no scratching cures. Bandages can crawl beneath your skin—figuratively, I hope.</line>
    <line>The worst itch is fear. Hard to scratch that one.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="ghost">
    <line>Ghosts, spirits, curses—I've faced them all. Animated bandages are somehow worse. They remember.</line>
    <line>I tried speaking with a ghost once. Even it feared the bandages.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="stain">
    <line>Every bandage tells a tale: blood, ink, and things best forgotten. Stains are history written in red.</line>
    <line>If a bandage resists cleaning, burn it. Trust me.</line>

  <entry keyword="night">
    <line>Night is their favorite time. The sound of slithering linen will keep you awake—if you’re lucky.</line>
    <line>I once dreamt of dancing bandages. I woke up bound to my own bed.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="wound">
    <line>Bandages are supposed to heal wounds, not create them. The world is full of cruel ironies.</line>
    <line>Some wounds are better left uncovered—especially when the bandages move on their own.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="burn">
    <line>Fire is the surest cure. Burn every cursed bandage you find. Do not hesitate.</line>
    <line>Smoke from burning linen smells of revenge—and regret.</line>

    <line>If you feel itchy after talking to me, it’s probably just nerves. Probably.</line>
    <line>Some say the itch never fades. I try not to think about it.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>The clinic closed after the disappearances. They blamed the rats. Fools.</line>
    <line>If you find a clinic with fresh bandages, run. Don’t look back.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="suture">
    <line>Sutures hold wounds together. Bandages hold nightmares. I know which I prefer.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen bandages try to stitch themselves to the living. Once was enough.</line>

  <entry keyword="book">
    <line>I keep my notes in a thick book, bound in leather—not linen, for obvious reasons.</line>
    <line>If you borrow my book, return it with clean hands and no scraps of cloth.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="scream">
    <line>Hospitals echo with screams. The silent ones are the worst—usually muffled by cloth.</line>
    <line>If you hear a bandage scream, you’ve already lost.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Bandages avoid mirrors. Perhaps they dislike seeing their own unraveling.</line>
    <line>When in doubt, check your reflection. Animated linen never casts one.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="needle">
    <line>Needles terrify some, but the bandages are immune. I tried pinning one to a board. It wriggled free.</line>
    <line>A needle can close a wound. It can’t close a curse.</line>
  </entry>
  <entry keyword="laundry">
    <line>Never leave bandages in the laundry overnight. They multiply—or disappear.</line>
    <line>I caught a Pestilent Bandage hiding in a laundry basket. It nearly cost me my hand.</line>

    <line>Everyone gets sick. Not everyone recovers. The Pestilent Bandages make sure of that.</line>

    <line>Phoenix ash corrupts everything. My orchard, my home—ruined by a single rising.</line>

  <entry keyword="rebirth">
    <line>Rebirth is the phoenix’s curse. Fire consumes it, and from ruin, it returns—uninvited, unrepentant.</line>
    <line>I have watched a phoenix burn and rise more times than I care to remember. Each time, I lost something precious.</line>
    <line>Rebirth is a cruelty for those left behind. My greatest loss was at the hands of a rising. Ask me of loss, if you must.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="loss">
    <line>Loss is the legacy of phoenixes. The fire took more than my orchard—it took my family’s memory, and my peace.</line>

    <line>She was brilliant. Dr. Veela Korvane. Saw beauty in darkness. Thought she could reason with one. It reasoned back.</line>

  <entry keyword="rune">
    <line>The rune on their back... it pulses. Alive. I've traced it a thousand times and still dream of teeth.</line>
    <line>Some claim it's a warding sigil. Others say it's a prison mark. Either way, it stares back when you look too long.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>Their blood is not red. It’s... shifting. Like spilled ink dreaming of escape.</line>
    <line>Touch their blood and your skin remembers it. Months later, I still smell it in my sleep.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eyes">
    <line>Too many. Too few. Always wrong. I once saw one weep from a socket that wasn’t there.</line>
    <line>Their eyes follow sound, not light. And sometimes they hum back when you speak near them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>They do not sleep. But they *hibernate*. Coiled in dread. Waking only when something nearby *hopes.*</line>
    <line>I tried to sleep in a tomb they once occupied. Woke up screaming 'It still listens.' I was alone.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sound">
    <line>Their claws click in rhythm—like a language, or a prayer. I think they're counting.</line>
    <line>They hum to the stones. Low and constant. The rocks respond… they *move.*</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flesh">
    <line>Their flesh is more shadow than muscle. Strike it, and your blade forgets it touched anything.</line>
    <line>I flayed one once. What was beneath wasn’t meat. It was ideas. And not kind ones.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hate">
    <line>I hate them because they took from me my mind’s light. And filled it with whispers.</line>
    <line>Hate is too soft a word. I despise them with the fury of a thousand sleepless nights.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="journal">
    <line>Veela's journal... I still read it. Some pages are blank until moonrise. Others bleed when touched.</line>
    <line>It ends with a drawing of an Abysmal Horror's eye. I burned the page. It came back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>The first sign is always the whisper—soft as breath, but it echoes like a scream.</line>
    <line>They don't speak aloud. They seep thoughts into yours. You stop thinking your own name.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>They hate mirrors. Or maybe mirrors hate them. Either way, mine cracked the night I brought back a sample.</line>
    <line>Reflections twist near them. I once saw mine blink when I didn't.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="skin">
    <line>They don’t wear skin—they *remember* it. Bits of it hang like robes of old regret.</line>
    <line>Their skin moves like it's remembering something. Or someone.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clock">
    <line>Clocks stop near them. I've had pocketwatches scream. Once, backwards.</line>
    <line>They don’t obey time. They observe it. And occasionally rearrange it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>Their bile is like ink. I used it once to write. The letters moved. The letter *responded.*</line>
    <line>Abysmal ink doesn't dry. It *absorbs* your words. Sometimes answers.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="teeth">
    <line>I counted forty-seven teeth in its mouth. Then it opened the second one.</line>
    <line>Their teeth aren't for chewing. They're for *holding*—souls, maybe. Or memories.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="crawl">
    <line>They crawl like they’ve forgotten how to walk. Or like walking was never *their* idea.</line>
    <line>Crawling things leave trails. Abysmals leave *questions.*</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>I used to dream of flying. Now I dream of falling—into *them.*</line>
    <line>Don't sleep after encountering one. They remember you. Through the veil.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cold">
    <line>The room drops five degrees when they pass. The silence drops *further.*</line>
    <line>Cold is comfort compared to their presence. You’ll *miss* cold once they find you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bones">
    <line>They don't leave bones. They *borrow* them. Sometimes return them—wrong.</line>
    <line>Found bones arranged in circles after one passed. Not human. Not... not anything I knew.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="book">
    <line>There’s a book they fear. Or maybe it fears *them.* Either way, it’s missing pages now.</line>
    <line>I read a passage aloud once. My dog hasn’t looked at me since.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="names">
    <line>They collect names. Not bodies. Names are stronger.</line>
    <line>Never speak your name near one. They *keep* it. Like a lock of hair.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="threshold">
    <line>They wait at thresholds. Between waking and sleep. Between choice and regret.</line>
    <line>Step through a doorway at the wrong time, you’ll meet one. And not leave whole.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="veil">
    <line>The veil is thin where they walk. I’ve seen dust fall up, and shadows delay themselves.</line>
    <line>Reality gets... uncertain. Around them. Like it forgets how to be *real.*</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lantern">
    <line>Their light kills lanterns. Not shatters. Not extinguishes. Just... *nullifies.*</line>
    <line>Hang a lantern and whisper their name. The flame dances. And listens.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smile">
    <line>They can’t smile. But something smiles *through* them.</line>
    <line>I saw one grin once. The mouth never moved. But I *felt* it smile.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wound">
    <line>Their wounds don’t bleed. They whisper. I stitched one once. The thread unstitched *me.*</line>
    <line>Scars left by them never fade. They just wait. Quietly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="child">
    <line>Children sense them first. Laughing, crying, or speaking backwards.</line>
    <line>A child once drew one in chalk. It erased itself. Slowly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="string">
    <line>They leave strings behind. Invisible. But tugging. Always tugging.</line>
    <line>You feel it, don’t you? Like something’s tied to your spine. That’s *them.*</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="key">
    <line>They don’t use doors. But they leave *keys.* None open locks. Just memories.</line>
    <line>Found a key after the last encounter. Opened a box I never owned. Inside was my own voice. Screaming.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>There’s music in their steps—like broken violins and distant sobbing.</line>
    <line>If you hear singing with no mouth nearby, don’t follow it. That’s how they *gather.*</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>You speak near them, and the echo answers wrong. Different words. Same tone.</line>
    <line>One echo repeated my sentence—but added *‘soon.’* I hadn’t said that.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="breath">
    <line>They don't breathe. But the room does—for them.</line>
    <line>One exhaled once. I watched frost grow on my bones.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="touch">
    <line>They don’t touch to harm. They touch to *mark.*</line>
    <line>A friend was touched once. He hasn’t blinked since. Says it wastes time.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="stone">
    <line>Where they walk, stone softens. Not melts. Just forgets how to be hard.</line>
    <line>I found handprints in granite once. Fingers were too long. One was *missing.*</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feast">
    <line>They don’t eat. They *feast.* On memory. On belief.</line>
    <line>Feeding isn’t messy. It’s quiet. And afterward, you’re not sure what was taken.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="regret">
    <line>Regret is a door. They walk through it, often.</line>
    <line>Think hard on a mistake. Wait long enough. They’ll find you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>Don’t make eye contact. They don't have eyes. Just places where eyes might *be.*</line>
    <line>One looked through me once. I saw things *inside out.*</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="laugh">
    <line>They laugh like glass breaking. You won't forget it. You won't *want* to, either.</line>
    <line>Heard one laugh once. My eardrum bled, but only on the inside.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="void">
    <line>They come from the void. Not the space between stars—but the space *between thoughts.*</line>
    <line>You feel it, don’t you? That cold pressure in your mind? That’s where they live.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chant">
    <line>They chant in silence. You hear it in your bones. In your dreams. Even when you’re awake.</line>
    <line>I recorded one once. Played it back. The wax cylinder melted and the rats in the walls screamed.</line>

    <line>Three decades of field notes. Gone. Melted. By one of the juveniles, no less.</line>
    <line>They defy categorization. The moment you think you’ve mapped their cycle—they evolve.</line>
    <line>I studied their acids, their breeding, their breath. Got a few scars for my trouble.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="acid">
    <line>Their spit melts plate. But the real danger is the mist. Lingers. Breathes back.</line>
    <line>You can’t bottle it. It dissolves glass, metal, and patience. Trust me.</line>
    <line>It smells like copper and betrayal. Tastes worse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vengeance">
    <line>They melted my library. My life's work! I want them studied. Then ended.</line>
    <line>One of them dissolved my apprentice. He was an idiot, but he was *my* idiot.</line>
    <line>Call it revenge. Call it research. Just kill ten of them, and maybe I’ll sleep again.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habitat">
    <line>Swamps, mostly. Or anywhere with enough rot and humidity to comfort a monster.</line>
    <line>They like warm, wet places. Which makes them easy to predict. And trap.</line>
    <line>I found one nesting in an abandoned forge once. Turned the anvil into a puddle.</line>

    <line>Bottles? Ha! You’d need a flask made of hubris and dragonbone.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="apprentice">
    <line>He thought he could tame one. It tamed him instead. Down to the marrow.</line>
    <line>Bright boy. Terrible judgment. The popper dissolved his boots first. Should’ve taken the hint.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mist">
    <line>The mist they exude is the real killer. Breathes in soft, eats out hard.</line>
    <line>It’s not steam. It’s a warning. Don’t inhale near them unless you want lungs like lace.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="alchemist">
    <line>Yes, I was an alchemist. Now I’m more of a bitter archivist of biological disasters.</line>
    <line>I don't invent potions anymore. I invent ways to kill AcidPoppers.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spit">
    <line>It's not just acidic. It's *targeted*. They aim. They enjoy it.</line>
    <line>Got a scar down my neck from one’s spit. Took three weeks before I could drink tea again.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="armor">
    <line>Forget armor. Their acid goes through plate like gossip through a village.</line>
    <line>You want to live? Wear regret and run fast. That’s the best armor against them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nest">
    <line>They don’t nest. They infest. Like mold with murder in its heart.</line>
    <line>You’ll smell it first—burnt mushrooms and metal. Then you’ll hear the bubbles.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="resistance">
    <line>Tried brewing resistance once. The flask exploded. Took the counter with it.</line>
    <line>No known potion stops their acid. Best you can hope for is dying with dignity.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tongue">
    <line>It flicks out, like a lizard, but sticky. Curious. Horrible.</line>
    <line>I had one sample its environment for thirty minutes. I was the environment.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sample">
    <line>I still have one in a jar. It hisses sometimes. Probably my imagination.</line>
    <line>You want a sample? Sure—bring a jar of regret and a prayer to whatever listens.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="burn">
    <line>Burn the corpse. Don’t bury it. Their fluids stay active for days.</line>
    <line>If you smell hair burning and no fire nearby, check your boots. One may be under you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="corrosion">
    <line>Everything corrodes. AcidPoppers just do it with more flair.</line>
    <line>I once saw one corrode a knight’s sword *through the scabbard*. He didn’t notice until it was just a hilt.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boots">
    <line>Lost six pairs of boots studying them. Don’t ask about the socks.</line>
    <line>AcidPopper acid goes straight through leather. Felt like walking on boiling regret.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="breeding">
    <line>Oh, they breed. Fast. Messy. Mostly in places you wish they wouldn’t.</line>
    <line>You ever see one split in half and both halves live? No? Stay lucky.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>They hum, you know. Low vibrations. Makes your bones itch.</line>
    <line>If you hear buzzing near an AcidPopper nest, it’s not bees. It’s something worse trying to *be* bees.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="swamp">
    <line>They thrive in swamps. Mushy ground, acidic muck, and a buffet of fools.</line>
    <line>The wetter the land, the more likely you’ll meet one. Or step in what’s left of someone who did.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whispers">
    <line>Sometimes I hear them whisper in the fog. That’s normal, right?</line>
    <line>One whispered my name once. I think. Or maybe I was dehydrated.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bones">
    <line>Their spit leaves bones clean. Gleaming, even. Horribly efficient.</line>
    <line>AcidPopper lairs are full of bones. Neat piles. Almost organized. That’s the worst part.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="teeth">
    <line>AcidPopper teeth? Like obsidian splinters—useless for chewing, perfect for puncturing.</line>
    <line>They don’t chew. They dissolve. Teeth are just decoration.</line>

    <line>No, they don’t have spores. Thank every god you know.</line>
    <line>They’re bad enough without breeding *airborne*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sympathy">
    <line>Do I *pity* them? Only as much as one pities a plague.</line>
    <line>They’re not evil. Just hungry. Constantly. Remorselessly.</line>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Held a mirror up to one once. It hissed, then kissed the glass. Then melted it.</line>
    <line>They don’t recognize themselves. Or maybe they *do*, and that’s what scared me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sound">
    <line>Their hiss? Like steam from a cursed kettle.</line>
    <line>They click when agitated. Like claws on bone. A terrible rhythm.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cloak">
    <line>This cloak? Acid-resistant. Mostly. Still itches.</line>
    <line>Don’t wear wool around them. It smokes. And not in a fashionable way.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>I tried to use their acid as ink. Burned straight through the page. And desk. And floor.</line>
    <line>AcidPopper acid *writes*—but only once. Then it writes through existence.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="larva">
    <line>Larvae? Don't get me started. They look like boiling worms. With legs.</line>
    <line>Step on one, and it pops. Guess what’s inside? You don’t want to know.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trap">
    <line>You can trap them. With bait. Preferably something already melting.</line>
    <line>Once caught one in a copper cage. It took three seconds to be free. I took a week to grow my eyebrows back.</line>

  <entry keyword="breath">
    <line>Their breath smells like vinegar, death, and warm pennies.</line>
    <line>You can tell one’s near when the air starts to feel... sharp.</line>

    <line>I had friends. Before I talked about AcidPoppers too much.</line>
    <line>You start studying these things, you stop getting dinner invitations. Coincidence?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>Sleep? Oh, I sleep fine. As long as I don’t think about how they melt through dreams.</line>
    <line>I once dreamed in acid. Woke up with my blankets half-gone. Still not sure how.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="color">
    <line>They come in many colors. None of them comforting.</line>
    <line>Bright green? Active. Deep blue? Recently fed. Red? Run faster.</line>

    <line>They don’t leave footprints. They leave *absences*. Holes in the world.</line>

    <line>It’s not rain. It’s not dew. That drip is your death ticking slowly down.</line>

    <line>Adornment is not vanity—it's an expression of identity! You seem like someone who might admire a fine necklace.</line>
    <line>Adornment defines stature and subtlety. Let us speak of that most radiant piece—the gold necklace.</line>
    <line>Adornment is an art form. I sense your curiosity may shine bright... like a gold necklace, perhaps?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gold necklace">
    <line>Ah, the gold necklace—timeless, elegant, and potent. But what makes it truly special is its aura.</line>
    <line>Gold necklaces carry not just shine, but memory. Their aura resonates—some say it even influences fate.</line>
    <line>Gold necklace... such a humble phrase for such majesty. It's the aura that sets each one apart.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="aura">
    <line>Aura is the unseen shimmer, the energy a necklace gathers over time. Curious about enchantment?</line>
    <line>Each aura tells a tale—enhanced by enchantment, of course.</line>
    <line>A true collector can sense aura. But to truly wield it, one must understand enchantment.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="enchantment">
    <line>Enchantment—where metal meets magic. But raw materials matter: purity is everything.</line>
    <line>Even the best enchantment is meaningless without pure gold. Would you discuss purity?</line>
    <line>Enchantment draws power, but purity ensures its clarity. Shall we speak of that?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="purity">
    <line>Purity is measured not in carats, but in intention. Only refined links channel true energy. Ever heard of chainwork?</line>
    <line>Pure gold sings when shaped just right. The true art lies in the chainwork.</line>
    <line>Purity brings strength, but it's the chainwork that gives character to the necklace.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chainwork">
    <line>Intricate chainwork binds the flow of energy. Some say it creates harmony—others, resilience. Know of resonance?</line>
    <line>The links must align to form resonance. That's the final test of a necklace’s craftsmanship.</line>
    <line>Chainwork is where function meets form. Resonance is what separates the mundane from the masterwork.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="resonance">
    <line>Resonance allows a necklace to attune to its bearer. The stronger the bond, the greater the effect.</line>
    <line>When a necklace resonates, it becomes more than an object—it becomes an extension of the self.</line>
    <line>Resonance... few understand it. Fewer still collect enough to study it properly. You may help with that, yes?</line>

  <entry keyword="rubies">
    <line>Rubies are passionate stones, but too volatile for fine necklace work. What about emeralds, more refined?</line>
    <line>Rubies stir desire. Emeralds soothe the mind. Perhaps you prefer the latter?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="emeralds">
    <line>Emeralds have their uses—healing, clarity, dreams. But they lack the structure for real resonance.</line>
    <line>Emeralds charm the mystics, but artisans crave foundation—like metal, not crystal. Pearls, though, pearls are curious.</line>

  <entry keyword="pearls">
    <line>Pearls are born of patience, not fire. But they do not bind energy well. Lovely for earrings, though.</line>

    <line>Bronze? Durable, yes. But it tarnishes with time—like flattery.</line>
    <line>Bronze sings of age and battle, not of resonance or harmony.</line>

    <line>Lapidary work is meticulous, yes. But stones distract from flow, unlike metal links.</line>
    <line>Gem-cutting is an art, but one I leave to others. I'm after the *hum* of construction.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="engraving">
    <line>Engraving tells stories, but sometimes it's better to listen than to inscribe.</line>
    <line>A beautiful inscription can trap meaning—but it may also limit resonance.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clasp">
    <line>Ah, the clasp! The unsung hero of adornment. Though rarely studied, it is key to balance.</line>
    <line>A necklace is only as sound as its clasp. But few admire it—too humble, perhaps.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="auction">
    <line>Auctions reduce beauty to bidding. I prefer discovery to competition.</line>
    <line>I once saw a necklace sell for 50,000 gold. But it had no resonance. Just nobles showing off.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="illusion">
    <line>Illusion magic can make tin shine like gold. But only true metal hums with memory.</line>
    <line>Illusions are for performers. I seek authenticity—even if it’s tarnished.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lineage">
    <line>Lineage adds mystique to an item, yes. But I care more for construction than ancestry.</line>
    <line>Some chase the bloodlines of items. I follow their harmonic design.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="draconic">
    <line>Draconic jewels are fabled, yes—but unstable. Gold alone is my constant.</line>
    <line>Dragons hoard treasure, but they don't *appreciate* it. That’s the difference, you see?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fashion house">
    <line>Bah! Fashion houses design for attention, not resonance. I’ve no patience for their flair.</line>
    <line>I once visited a fashion house gala. All shimmer, no soul.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="curse">
    <line>Yes, cursed jewelry exists. But I find it more intriguing when the enchantment is subtle.</line>
    <line>A curse is just enchantment with poor intent. Still, I prefer clarity to menace.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>Some necklaces play a role in rituals, but I study their structure, not their ceremony.</line>
    <line>Rituals often distort the true purpose of adornment—harmony, not theatrics.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weight">
    <line>Weight affects resonance! A necklace too heavy dampens the flow of energy.</line>
    <line>A light necklace hums clearly. Too much weight and the aura sinks beneath it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fashion">
    <line>Fashion fades. Function endures. And only gold bridges the two.</line>
    <line>Fashion is the wind; gold is the anchor. We are here for purpose, not parade.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silver">
    <line>Silver is fine for moon charms and mirror spells. But it lacks the density of gold.</line>
    <line>Silver is soft-spoken, where gold declares. I study resonance, not reflections.</line>

    <line>Ah, a fellow admirer of agapite! Its rose-gold hue is unrivaled, wouldn't you agree? But its true wonder lies beneath its shimmer. Perhaps you've pondered its resonance?</line>
    <line>So few appreciate the subtle gleam of agapite. Have you heard about its unique resonance?</line>

  <entry keyword="resonance">
    <line>Agapite’s resonance isn’t just legend—it sings in the forge! Curious how it's different from valorite?</line>
    <line>The resonance of agapite is gentle, unlike the fierce vibrations of valorite. The difference is, well, illuminating.</line>
    <line>Resonance, yes! It gives agapite its unique charm. Have you compared it to valorite?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="valorite">
    <line>Valorite is powerful, but agapite... agapite is elegant. I’d wager it’s better for enchanted tools. Have you ever used agapite for crafting?</line>
    <line>Valorite may have brute force, but agapite rewards the delicate touch of a master crafter.</line>

  <entry keyword="crafting">
    <line>Crafting with agapite yields tools of rare precision. Though, without the right flux, the metal can be quite stubborn.</line>
    <line>The secret to crafting with agapite? It’s all in the flux. The wrong blend, and it crumbles.</line>
    <line>Have you ever tried to shape agapite without proper flux? It’s an exercise in futility!</line>

  <entry keyword="flux">
    <line>Flux binds agapite’s willful nature. My favorite is made with fire beetle ash. Have you experimented with fire beetles?</line>
    <line>Fire beetle ash—rare, but the best flux for agapite. Only true metallurgists dare collect it.</line>
    <line>You needn’t risk your beard over bad flux! Fire beetle ash does the trick, though acquiring it is a tale itself.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire beetle">
    <line>A fire beetle’s ash burns with magical potential! Some say it even protects against poison. Have you ever gathered the ash yourself?</line>
    <line>Those who hunt fire beetles know their worth. Ash from their carapace—priceless in the right hands.</line>
    <line>Fire beetles: dangerous, but their ashes are legendary for flux. Care to know my secret for gathering it?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ash">
    <line>Ash—the unsung hero of metallurgy! But without a proper crucible, it's wasted.</line>
    <line>Only the best ash should touch agapite. I use a crucible from the lost dwarven forges.</line>
    <line>They say the right ash, in the right crucible, can coax secrets from even the shyest metals.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="crucible">
    <line>A dwarven crucible! Forged in ancient fires, it withstands any heat. But mine yearns for more agapite...</line>
    <line>A good crucible is a crafter's best friend. But it's nothing without the right metal—agapite, of course.</line>

    <line>Magic and metallurgy are closer than most think. Agapite is rumored to enhance magical properties.</line>

  <entry keyword="jewelry">
    <line>Agapite jewelry? Fashionable, but I find its strength wasted on adornment.</line>

  <entry keyword="trade">
    <line>Agapite fetches a fine price in the right markets. But who would part with such beauty?</line>
    <line>Traders love agapite—until they try to carry a cart full. Heavy is the head that wears the crown, and heavier is the cart that carries the ingots.</line>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>Agapite gleams like moonlight on still water. Maybe that’s why I mine at night.</line>

    <line>Rotten meat, fish oil, and a little blood — best bait you’ll ever use. Or smell.</line>
    <line>Gators aren’t picky. You just have to be loud enough to catch their attention, and slow enough to regret it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fog">
    <line>Swamp fog lies. It makes the gators seem farther than they are. Until it’s too late.</line>
    <line>Fog's a blessing. Hides your fear. Sometimes even hides your scent. Not always, though.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>I don’t sleep much. When I do, I hear water moving and jaws snapping. Can’t tell if it’s memory or warning.</line>
    <line>Sleep near a swamp and you dream their dreams. It’s… unsettling.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="coin">
    <line>Dropped a coin in the swamp once. Watched it vanish into the muck. Just like my brother.</line>
    <line>If you find a gold coin with bite marks, don't pick it up. That gator’s still looking for it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whistle">
    <line>They react to high sounds — whistles, bird calls. Might be curiosity. Might be rage.</line>
    <line>Used to carry a whistle. Not anymore. One came running when I blew it. With friends.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="claw">
    <line>Their claws aren't for slashing — they hold you in place while the teeth do their work.</line>
    <line>Ever seen a gator climb? You’d think they can’t. You’d be wrong.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="skin">
    <line>The skin is thick, sure. But underneath? Just as soft and breakable as ours. You just have to get *there*.</line>
    <line>I wear some of their hide. Not for armor — for penance.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>I once looked into the water and saw my own eyes — but they blinked the wrong way.</line>
    <line>The swamp reflects lies. Don’t trust your reflection near gator water.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>I hum sometimes. Not for comfort. To let the gators know I’m still alive.</line>
    <line>There’s a tune the locals won’t sing. Says it calls the Old One from the deep marsh. I hummed it once. Regret that.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bones">
    <line>The swamp eats bones slower than you’d think. But the gators get first pick.</line>
    <line>Found a ribcage once, half-crushed and half-clean. Gator work. Surgical.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Fire scares them… sometimes. But don’t rely on it. Wet scales laugh at flames.</line>
    <line>I used to light torches around my camp. One night, they were all snuffed. Quietly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="drowning">
    <line>It’s not the water that kills you — it’s the quiet panic. The long goodbye.</line>
    <line>Gators drown you not out of cruelty. It’s just how they dine.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mark">
    <line>They mark territory with scratches and musk. But some use... bones. Arranged ones.</line>
    <line>I found a tree once, carved with claw marks too deliberate to be chance. I left. Quickly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>They move more under the full moon. I think they remember being dragons.</line>
    <line>The moonlight gives them purpose. Or madness. Same thing in the swamp.</line>

  <entry keyword="trap">
    <line>I bait with rotten meat, but some of them learn. They avoid the snares now.</line>
    <line>My traps work on most gators. The smart ones… they laugh. I swear they laugh.</line>

    <line>Ah, amber! Trapped within its glow are secrets of forgotten ages.</line>
    <line>Few appreciate amber for what it truly is: time made visible. Curious about its origins?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="origins">
    <line>Amber begins as tree resin, seeping from bark and hardening over millennia.</line>
    <line>It all starts with resin—a tree's tears, hardened over eons.</line>
    <line>Resin flowed from ancient forests, and time turned it to amber. Intrigued by resin itself?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="resin">
    <line>Resin was once used in incense, rituals, even medicine. A conduit of life and power.</line>
    <line>Sticky, golden resin—nature’s preservative. Insects, leaves... even air became immortal inside it.</line>
    <line>Did you know some think resin carries memories? It binds time and scent. Shall we speak of insects?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="insects">
    <line>Yes, insects—perfectly preserved in amber, as if frozen mid-breath.</line>
    <line>Fossilized bugs are the crown jewels of amber. Some call them nature's relics.</line>
    <line>The most prized amber contains insects, wings intact. Almost... watching. But the real mystery is the light.</line>

    <line>Amber glows with a warmth no gem can match. It captures light, but also... something else.</line>

    <line>Light lingers in amber. Ancient light. But it’s said the stone can also carry sound...</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sound">
    <line>Some amber hums faintly when rubbed. Electrum, the ancients called it—living stone.</line>
    <line>Have you heard it? That faint whisper when you press amber to your ear? Myth, perhaps.</line>
    <line>Amber and sound, a forgotten bond. The Greeks believed it summoned spirits. Speaking of, do you know electrum?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="electrum">
    <line>Electrum—where amber meets myth. A word of power, used for both gold and glowing stone.</line>
    <line>To the ancients, electrum was sacred. Amber, static with energy, used in rites and tools.</line>
    <line>Electrum linked gods and mortals. But I need no gods—just amber. Quite a lot of it, actually.</line>

  <entry keyword="pendant">
    <line>A pendant of amber can warm the skin. Some say it eases pain or grants clarity.</line>
    <line>Amber pendants are sold in markets, but few know what they wear. It's not just fashion—it's memory.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="memory">
    <line>Amber is said to hold ancient memories. But how to unlock them? That’s the real puzzle.</line>
    <line>What if the past lives inside each piece, waiting to be remembered? A scholar’s dream, truly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>I dream of a world where amber speaks—of beasts, forests, even lost empires.</line>
    <line>Dreams guided me to amber. Some nights, I see a golden forest, glistening like fire.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Amber burns with a fragrant smoke. It once lit sacred rites in old temples.</line>
    <line>In flame, amber sings. Scented smoke, glowing embers. Strange, isn’t it?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="temple">
    <line>Temples of the old sun cults used amber in their altars. A symbol of eternal light.</line>
    <line>It’s said priests carved runes into amber, believing it held the sun’s favor.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tree">
    <line>Amber begins with trees—great ancient giants. I often wonder if they knew what treasure they wept.</line>
    <line>Trees bled their essence into time, and amber is the relic left behind. A wooden whisper, if you will.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="forest">
    <line>Imagine a forest that no longer exists, yet still lives in amber. That’s the magic of preservation.</line>
    <line>They say amber holds echoes of vanished forests. I like to think each piece is a leaf from a memory.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sap">
    <line>Sap, yes—resin’s young form. Sticky, sweet, but not yet eternal. Touch it, and you're part of the cycle.</line>
    <line>Sap hardens slowly. What begins as a nuisance becomes a relic. I always found that... poetic.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fossil">
    <line>Amber is a kind of fossil, yes—but not of bone or shell. It preserves motion, emotion. Even fear.</line>
    <line>Unlike bones, amber fossilizes moments. A wingbeat frozen in time. A struggle that never ends.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="static">
    <line>Rub amber on wool—it crackles! Ancient scholars called it ‘electron’ and thought it divine.</line>
    <line>Amber generates static, yes. A parlor trick to some, but perhaps... a key to ancient energy?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sunlight">
    <line>Amber is sunlight made solid, some believe. Held in golden hands for thousands of years.</line>
    <line>Sunlight sleeps inside amber. That’s why it glows warmly—even in the coldest hands.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="beetle">
    <line>A beetle caught in amber is both tragedy and art. Life interrupted, yet immortalized.</line>
    <line>Beetles, ants, even tiny lizards have been found in amber. Nature's accidental museum.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Some say amber acts like a mirror—not of faces, but of thoughts. It reflects intent.</line>
    <line>Hold amber to your eye. Does it reflect the world... or something deeper?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tears">
    <line>Poets call amber 'the tears of time.' Fitting, if you ask me.</line>
    <line>Amber as tears? A lovely myth. But resin is survival, not sorrow. Even trees weep with purpose.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="alchemy">
    <line>Alchemists once ground amber into elixirs—claimed it cured melancholy and stirred memory.</line>
    <line>In powdered form, amber was used in tinctures, oils... even love potions. Not all of them worked, mind you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="healing">
    <line>Old wives speak of amber easing pain. Worn near the skin, it 'draws out the humors,' they say.</line>
    <line>Amber was used in folk medicine. Ground, boiled, worn—sometimes with effect, often with flair.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gold">
    <line>Amber is not gold, though it gleams like it. I’d argue it’s rarer—gold does not preserve a gnat mid-flight.</line>
    <line>Gold glitters, yes, but amber glows. That warmth is something else entirely.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ring">
    <line>An amber ring worn on the left hand is said to protect against deception. Curious old charm.</line>
    <line>I once wore an amber ring. Lost it in a swamp. Still convinced it knew something I didn't.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lantern">
    <line>Some mages believe amber shards in lanterns amplify light spells. I’ve yet to prove it... but the glow is enchanting.</line>
    <line>Amber-filtered light soothes the mind. Or so claims a monk I met in Ilshenar.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Amber holds light, but casts strange shadows. They twist like memories.</line>
    <line>Its glow is soft, but amber’s shadow is sharp. A strange contradiction.</line>

    <line>What if amber preserves things we can’t see? Energy. Thought. Dreams.</line>
    <line>The invisible made visible—that’s the promise of amber. Or its lie.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glass">
    <line>Amber is not glass, though they look alike. Glass forgets. Amber remembers.</line>
    <line>Unlike glass, amber distorts what it shows. Some say it lets you glimpse the world as it was.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trade">
    <line>Amber was once traded like gold along ancient roads. A caravan’s dream, a thief’s delight.</line>
    <line>There are cities that rose on the amber trade alone. Their stones still glitter in the desert sun.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="curse">
    <line>One shard of amber in my collection is said to be cursed. I’ve yet to be proven wrong or right.</line>

    <line>You've an eye for true beauty. Amethyst is my muse. Let us speak of clarity, if you will.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clarity">
    <line>Clarity is more than the absence of flaw; it's the presence of purpose. That’s where facets come in.</line>
    <line>True clarity reveals the soul of the stone. Would you consider the facets next?</line>
    <line>Clarity defines a gem's light, but facets shape its dance. Shall we talk facets?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="facets">
    <line>Facets are the truths cut into a stone. A single gem may wear many faces. Next, the cut determines destiny.</line>
    <line>Each facet is a decision. Each edge, a story. But the cut—ah, the cut shapes the tale!</line>
    <line>Facets reflect, but it’s the cut that decides the journey of light. Interested in discussing the cut?</line>

  <entry keyword="cut">
    <line>A perfect cut is an act of reverence. Yet even the finest cut needs harmony with the luster.</line>
    <line>One cannot admire a cut without noticing its companion: the gem’s luster. Shall we explore that shimmer?</line>
    <line>Cut sharpens brilliance—but without luster, what would it all mean?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="luster">
    <line>Luster is the soul’s glow, trapped in crystalline skin. And where there's luster, there's energy.</line>
    <line>A gem’s luster whispers of power. Magic practitioners often sense energy in its glow. Curious?</line>
    <line>Luster draws both scholars and sorcerers. It hints at energy yet unseen.</line>

    <line>Yes, amethysts hum with ancient energy. Did you know they're said to guard against intoxication? Madness too. One must understand resonance.</line>
    <line>Amethyst energy aligns with clarity of mind and spirit. But only through resonance is it properly channeled.</line>
    <line>Energy flows through the gem as a river through stone. Resonance is the key to focus it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="resonance">
    <line>Resonance reveals intent. When aligned with purpose, it amplifies creation. That is why I seek attunement.</line>
    <line>The resonance of a gem must match its wielder—or chaos follows. You must attune it to your own soul.</line>
    <line>To master resonance, one must attune each gem. And attunement is no simple feat...</line>

    <line>Rings bind, protect, and sometimes betray. One should never wear a cursed one... twice.</line>

  <entry keyword="sleep">

    <line>Funny how a pile of coins glitters, but never glows. No soul in them, just shine.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chisel">
    <line>A gem respects the chisel like a scroll respects ink: reluctantly, but inevitably.</line>
    <line>The chisel is truth’s edge. Carve too hard, and it shatters. Too soft, and the stone laughs at you.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bones">
    <line>You’ll find bones near their pits. Polished clean. Arranged like art.</line>
    <line>Ant Lions don’t eat bones. They leave them—decorated, like a warning.</line>

    <line>A still wind in the desert? That’s when they’re listening.</line>

  <entry keyword="eye">

    <line>Scarab shells litter their pits. Either a snack or a rival.</line>
    <line>Ant Lions don’t tolerate competition. Scarabs go first.</line>

    <line>The desert is their cathedral. Endless, quiet, deadly.</line>
    <line>Most people fear starvation or sunstroke. I fear what’s *under* the sand.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>I swear the pits echo back my voice—but changed. As if answering.</line>
    <line>I once heard my own scream return from a pit. It wasn’t the same scream.</line>

    <line>Desert glass forms near their pits. Too much heat, too much fury.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen molten glass around the deeper nests. Something burns down there.</line>

    <line>I once stared into a nest for five minutes. Came back to a missing sun.</line>

  <entry keyword="heat">
    <line>Heat draws them. They feel it. Hunger follows warmth.</line>
    <line>A campfire in their dunes is like ringing a dinner bell with blood.</line>

  <entry keyword="skin">
    <line>Their skin isn’t skin—it’s layered exoshell. Flexible, but cruel.</line>
    <line>I tried to flay one once. The blade dulled. The scream didn’t.</line>

    <line>They don’t eat often. But when they do, they gorge—on screams.</line>
    <line>A feast for an Ant Lion ends with silence. Not even echoes remain.</line>

    <line>Ah, you too are tempted by the golden glow of apple pie? A rare delight!</line>
    <line>Apple pie is the pinnacle of pastry art! It’s the filling, you know, that holds the secret.</line>
    <line>An apple pie, perfectly baked, is the highest achievement. But what do you know of its filling?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="filling">
    <line>The filling is an alchemy of apples, spice, and just a hint of lemon. But the right apple makes all the difference.</line>
    <line>A good filling balances sweet and tart. The apple you choose is crucial.</line>
    <line>No filling is complete without the right apple—do you prefer tart or sweet apples?</line>

  <entry keyword="apple">
    <line>The tartness of a Granny Smith or the sweetness of a Honeycrisp—each brings something new. But truly, it’s the spices that define a pie.</line>
    <line>Apples are the heart, but spices are the soul! Which spices do you favor in your apple pie?</line>
    <line>It all begins with the apple, but no pie is memorable without the right blend of spice.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spice">
    <line>Cinnamon and nutmeg, sometimes a dash of clove. But my secret is a touch of vanilla.</line>
    <line>Spice brings warmth and depth. Cinnamon, nutmeg, and maybe even cardamom. But a pie is nothing without its crust.</line>
    <line>A blend of spice makes the filling sing, but have you ever truly admired a pie’s crust?</line>

  <!-- RED HERRING DIALOGUE CHAIN -->

  <entry keyword="lemon">
    <line>A little lemon adds brightness to the filling. Some prefer orange zest—though that’s a risky twist.</line>
    <line>Lemon sharpens the flavor, but too much can overwhelm. Have you ever tried zesting an orange instead?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="orange">
    <line>Orange zest is bold, but purists may protest. Why not try pears in your pie for something truly different?</line>
    <line>Orange and apple—a daring combination. Still, I once tasted a pie made with pears. Quite unusual!</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pear">
    <line>Pears in pie are rare, but intriguing. Yet nothing beats the classic apple.</line>
    <line>Pear pies exist, but they lack the character of a true apple pie. Do you prefer nuts in your pastry?</line>

  <entry keyword="nuts">
    <line>A walnut or pecan crust can be divine, but not everyone approves. I prefer tradition.</line>

  <entry keyword="cheese">
    <line>Cheddar with apple pie—controversial, yet surprisingly delicious! Some even insist on a scoop of ice cream instead.</line>
    <line>A slice of sharp cheddar atop warm apple pie is a secret delight. But ice cream is more popular, of course.</line>

  <entry keyword="ice cream">
    <line>Vanilla ice cream melting over a hot slice—heavenly! But I’m a purist at heart.</line>
    <line>Ice cream and pie—a classic duo. But nothing compares to a well-made pie on its own.</line>

  <entry keyword="bread">
    <line>Bread is the backbone of any table, but lacks the sweetness of a pie. Ever tried bread pudding? It’s pie’s humble cousin.</line>
    <line>Some say a good baker begins with bread. I say, end with pie!</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sugar">
    <line>Sugar must be measured with care—too much, and you mask the apple’s flavor. Have you ever tried pies sweetened with honey?</line>
    <line>Sugar or honey, white or brown—each gives a pie a different personality.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="honey">
    <line>Honey lends a golden touch, but it’s best with fresh apples. It reminds me of summer orchards.</line>
    <line>Some use honey for sweetness, but nothing replaces a crisp tart apple.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cinnamon">
    <line>Cinnamon—some sprinkle it on everything! I once met a baker who used so much, his pies were brown as earth.</line>
    <line>Too much cinnamon can overpower—balance is key! Nutmeg is the secret spice, if you ask me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nutmeg">
    <line>Nutmeg adds warmth, but a little goes a long way. I once grated my thumb instead of the nutmeg—painful lesson.</line>
    <line>A pinch of nutmeg, and a pie sings. But beware—more than a pinch and you’ve got trouble.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cardamom">
    <line>Cardamom is exotic! Rarely found in apple pie, but those who try it are never the same.</line>
    <line>Cardamom in pie? Adventurous! Some say it’s magical, but I prefer to keep my magic subtle.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vanilla">
    <line>Vanilla is the quiet hero of the spice world. Just a drop will do. Too much, and the apples hide.</line>
    <line>Pure vanilla brings out the best in any filling, but it’s so expensive these days!</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="apron">
    <line>A stained apron is the mark of a true baker. I keep mine spotless, oddly enough.</line>

  <entry keyword="flour">
    <line>Flour everywhere! It gets in the cracks, the air, even the cat’s whiskers.</line>
    <line>Flour is essential for crust, but too much makes it tough. Balance, always balance.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eggs">
    <line>Eggs give the crust richness. But the chickens have been stubborn this week.</line>
    <line>A baker is only as good as their eggs—or so my grandmother claimed.</line>

  <entry keyword="oven mitt">
    <line>Never trust an oven mitt with a hole! The pain of a burn lingers long after the pie is gone.</line>
    <line>The bravest bakers bear the scars of hasty hands and hot pans.</line>

  <entry keyword="festival">
    <line>Every festival needs pie! Last year, mine won third place—scandalous! Clearly, the judges preferred plum.</line>
    <line>I bake pies for every festival—once, I made one as big as a cartwheel.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="judges">
    <line>Pie judges are notoriously fickle—one likes more spice, another hates crust. Pleasing them is a true quest.</line>
    <line>Judging pies is a noble art, but I suspect some are bribed with extra slices.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="competition">
    <line>Pie competitions bring out the fiercest bakers. Friendship ends at the oven door.</line>
    <line>Competition is healthy—they say, but nothing stings like a pie defeat!</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cider">
    <line>A mug of cider pairs well with a fresh slice. Warm, spiced, and perfect on a cold morning.</line>
    <line>Cider and pie—two ways to appreciate apples. But pie is always the winner in my book.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="maple">
    <line>Maple syrup in apple pie? A bold move! I tried it once, but it was far too sweet for my taste.</line>
    <line>Maple’s earthiness is best left to pancakes. Pie needs the clean taste of apple.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="turnover">
    <line>Apple turnovers—pie’s handy cousin! But I find them too small for my appetite.</line>
    <line>Turnovers are for those in a hurry. I prefer to savor my pie, one forkful at a time.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fork">
    <line>Fork or fingers? True aficionados debate the matter endlessly. I say, use whatever gets the pie to your mouth fastest.</line>
    <line>The best pie makes you forget you’re holding a fork at all.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="family">
    <line>My family taught me all I know—pie is our legacy. Except cousin Benny. He burns water.</line>
    <line>Pie brings families together—and sometimes tears them apart at the last slice.</line>

  <entry keyword="friendship">
    <line>Nothing forges friendship like sharing a pie. Or fighting over the last piece.</line>
    <line>A true friend never takes the last slice without asking.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>Pastry is a broad field! Pies, tarts, turnovers… but none surpass the humble apple pie.</line>
    <line>Pastry craft is endless, but my passion always returns to apple pie.</line>

  <entry keyword="arcane">
    <line>They draw power from planar cracks—leaking sorcery like smoke from a dying star.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hatred">
    <line>I hate them because I loved them. Studied them. Trusted the patterns—and lost everything.</line>
    <line>One tore through my sanctum. My apprentices became *things*. Screaming spell-eaters.</line>
    <line>My life's work became a doorway. They walked through. I buried the rest.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>They nest in places of raw magic—old ley lines, forgotten libraries, broken towers.</line>
    <line>Arcane Daemons feed on spellcasters. Or worse—they *become* them.</line>
    <line>They don’t sleep. They meditate in hovering silence, rewriting the rules around them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weakness">
    <line>Overload them. Flood the air with raw mana. Their greed becomes their cage.</line>
    <line>Reflected magic wounds them. Use mirrors. Glyph traps. Iron laced with silver runes.</line>
    <line>They recoil from chaos. The truly random. The disordered. Bring madness to fight madness.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="revenge">
    <line>I no longer teach. I *eradicate*. Each slain daemon restores a shred of my soul.</line>
    <line>Revenge is my syllabus now. Let their corpses be my final thesis.</line>
    <line>They wrote tragedy in spellfire. I write rebuttals in blood.</line>

  </entry>

    <line>I mapped their crossings once. The ink vanished. The parchment laughed.</line>
    <line>No map holds them. They rewrite geography by stepping on it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="time">
    <line>Time bends around them. I lost a week once. Gained it back—wrong.</line>
    <line>They don’t experience time. They *negotiate* with it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>They don’t blink. Even when screaming.</line>
    <line>An Arcane Daemon’s eye sees your soul’s blueprint. And corrects it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silver">
    <line>Silver doesn’t hurt them—but it makes them flinch. That’s enough.</line>
    <line>A silver circle delays them. Doesn’t stop them. Nothing does.</line>

  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>I study the ArchDaemons—not by choice anymore, but by necessity.</line>
    <line>Once I summoned them. Now I chart their deaths. A penance paid in blood.</line>
    <line>My job? Understanding ArchDaemons. My curse? Understanding them *too well*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="archdaemon">
    <line>They are lies made flesh—malice wrapped in ancient wisdom. I once called one master.</line>
    <line>An ArchDaemon's voice can charm a priest, then silence a god. I've heard it. Survived it.</line>
    <line>Beautiful in form, monstrous in soul. I admired them. Once. Before the scars.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="admire">
    <line>They are elegant beasts. Strategic. Poetic. Every movement a sermon in superiority.</line>
    <line>There’s a dark artistry in what they do. It sickens me to admit it—but I respect it.</line>
    <line>What is admiration but a weakness cloaked in longing? I admired them—and it nearly cost me my soul.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hate">
    <line>Hate is the only chain strong enough to bind memory. I *hate* what they made me.</line>
    <line>They used me. Whispered truth until it became poison. Now I return the favor—with steel.</line>
    <line>Hatred sharpens the mind. Mine is a blade honed on infernal betrayal.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="betrayal">
    <line>They promised knowledge. I gave them blood. They took more.</line>
    <line>My brother walked into their fire, singing their praises. He walked out ashes.</line>
    <line>I summoned one once. It whispered secrets. Then took my name, and nearly my soul.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="summon">
    <line>Summoning them is not a ritual. It is an invitation to annihilation.</line>
    <line>You summon one, you are no longer *you*. It rewrites you. Cell by cell. Thought by thought.</line>
    <line>I still dream in their language. I wake screaming.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="voice">
    <line>Their voice is velvet death. Truth wrapped in beauty. It ruins minds.</line>
    <line>One word from an ArchDaemon and armies kneel. I wore earthen wax when I faced one. Still, I heard it in my bones.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weakness">
    <line>Their pride. It blinds them. Makes them linger when they should flee.</line>
    <line>Holy fire hurts them—but it's their own hunger that kills them. Feed it lies, then strike.</line>
    <line>They trust their own reflection too much. Show them a mirror, and they'll admire it before they notice your blade.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="revenge">
    <line>This isn't just revenge. It's reclamation. Of identity. Of will.</line>
    <line>I don't kill them for justice. I kill them for *balance*. For every soul they’ve warped.</line>
    <line>They took everything from me. Every ArchDaemon that dies is one name less on my list.</line>

  </entry>

  <!-- Flavor / Red Herrings -->

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>An ArchDaemon once asked me what I saw in a mirror. I answered. It laughed. I still don’t know why.</line>
    <line>Mirrors are dangerous around them. They reflect more than light. They reflect truths you’re not ready for.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>This burn? Its laughter did that. No flame. Just *presence.*</line>
    <line>Scars remind me what listening costs. I wear them proudly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flame">
    <line>Holy flame is the only thing they fear. Even then, they don’t *run*—they *sneer*.</line>
    <line>Flame cleanses. But you have to survive long enough to light the match.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eyes">
    <line>Their eyes aren’t eyes. They're portals into doubt. Don’t stare back.</line>
    <line>I stared once. Saw my future unravel. Still trying to weave it back together.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sigil">
    <line>Their sigils still burn into stone. I carve them in reverse to ward off nightmares.</line>
    <line>I know their marks. My skin remembers. I dream of sigils still bleeding light.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="name">
    <line>Names are currency to them. Yours is worth more if you whisper it in fear.</line>
    <line>Don’t give them your name. Not even a nickname. They *eat* identity.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="library">
    <line>I burned my library after one spoke through the pages. Fire was the only silencing that worked.</line>
    <line>Books bound in daemon-skin whisper. Learn once, regret forever.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>Blood fuels their rites—but memory stains their altars more deeply.</line>
    <line>They don’t need your blood. They want your *intention*. Blood’s just... symbolic.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ashes">
    <line>Everything they touch ends in ash—cities, hearts, faith.</line>
    <line>Ashes don’t lie. They tell you what burned, and what *used* to be alive.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>I don’t sleep. I *pause*. Real sleep ended the night I heard its whisper in a dream.</line>
    <line>Sleep brings them back. Not in form, but in memory. Worse, somehow.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="breath">
    <line>They don’t breathe—but you’ll feel your lungs tighten near one. Like the air fears them too.</line>
    <line>One exhale from an ArchDaemon turned a knight to stone. I watched. I ran.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadows">
    <line>They don’t cast shadows. They *absorb* them.</line>
    <line>If the shadows grow longer and colder—you’re not alone. You’re *observed*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wound">
    <line>Their wounds don’t bleed—they whisper. It sounds like guilt.</line>
    <line>You stab one, and your blade weeps. Not metaphor. I *cleaned it* myself.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="circle">
    <line>Summoning circles don’t hold them. They only entertain.</line>
    <line>I once stepped into the wrong circle. It’s why I limp now—and why I *don’t dream alone*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="teeth">
    <line>They don’t chew. They don’t need to. Their teeth are for show—and *fear*.</line>
    <line>One bite from them, and you don’t just bleed. You *forget* what pain is supposed to feel like.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cloak">
    <line>They wear cloaks made of night and regret. I stitched one once. Never again.</line>
    <line>The cloak moved on its own. I burned it. Still smelled like my childhood home.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sigils">
    <line>Even erased, their sigils *remember*. I've seen stone cry ink.</line>
    <line>I found a child drawing one in the sand. She said a friend whispered it while she slept.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>They leave echoes behind—not sounds. *Thoughts.* I’ve caught them whispering in empty halls.</line>
    <line>An echo led me to a ruin. The ruin led me to madness.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smile">
    <line>Their smile is never meant for you. It’s for something behind you.</line>
    <line>I saw one smile at a corpse. Then the corpse stood up and wept.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>Their contracts bleed ink even after signing. The paper drinks your name.</line>
    <line>I tried to burn one. The flame turned *cold*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feather">
    <line>A single feather fell from its wings—if you can call them wings. It hummed until I buried it.</line>
    <line>I once traded a feather for my freedom. It grew back the next day, inside my skin.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smoke">
    <line>Their smoke whispers. It told me the date of my death. So far, it’s been wrong.</line>
    <line>Smoke lingered for days. Nothing burned—but *something* had ended.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="finger">
    <line>I found a severed finger after the summoning. It pointed—then vanished.</line>
    <line>Never trust what they *leave behind*. It’s never truly left.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bell">
    <line>When you hear bells without a source, don’t ask questions. Just run.</line>
    <line>They hate bells. Or maybe they *need* them. Either way, silence them at your peril.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>Their music doesn’t need instruments. It plays in your spine.</line>
    <line>A bard once tried to mimic their song. His ears never stopped bleeding.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gift">
    <line>They always offer a gift. Never accept. Never *touch* it.</line>
    <line>I accepted once. It was a memory that wasn’t mine. I still wake up speaking in tongues.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silence">
    <line>Their silence is worse than their voice. In the quiet, you *feel* the judgment.</line>
    <line>When it goes quiet around them, something sacred is about to die.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="candle">
    <line>I lit a candle in their presence. It screamed before dying.</line>
    <line>They extinguish light like they extinguish faith—slowly, and with pleasure.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="regret">
    <line>You think regret weakens me? No. It *fortifies*. Every regret is a shield against them.</line>
    <line>Regret is the only ward that never fades.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="truth">
    <line>They offer truth like poison wrapped in honey. Sweet, fatal.</line>

    <line>Ash—tall, proud, and strong. A noble tree with wood that sings when struck. Are you drawn to lumber, friend?</line>

    <line>AshLog is a marvel! Strong and springy. Its grain is its soul. Shall we talk of grain?</line>
    <line>There’s a rhythm to AshLog grain, like the beat of a heart. Look closely—grain tells stories.</line>

  <entry keyword="grain">
    <line>Grain channels force, disperses tension. In the right hands, it creates resonance.</line>
    <line>The grain aligns with intent. That’s why Ash resonates so well. Curious about resonance?</line>
    <line>Grain defines flow. And flow creates resonance—essential for my craft, in fact.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="resonance">
    <line>Resonance isn’t just sound—it’s spirit responding to form. Ash wood shapes beautifully.</line>
    <line>To feel resonance is to know when the wood agrees with you. That’s when shaping begins.</line>

    <line>The pinnacle of demonic arrogance. Beauty wrapped in flame and blood.</line>
    <line>A Balron doesn’t fight — it *judges*. Every strike is a verdict.</line>
    <line>Ask a fool what a Balron is. Ask me how it *thinks*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="demon">
    <line>Balrons command demons like thoughts command flesh.</line>
    <line>Demons lie, cheat, and kill. Balrons *choose* when they do each.</line>
    <line>If a demon snarls, fear it. If it smiles — run. That smile belongs to a Balron.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hate">
    <line>Hate is too small a word. I want their name *forgotten*, their echoes smothered.</line>
    <line>I don’t hate them because they hurt me. I hate them because they *spared* me.</line>
    <line>They let me live… to remember. I’ll let them die — so I can *forget*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="study">
    <line>I spent years in old ruins, reading words no sane soul should mouth, just to understand them.</line>
    <line>To fight a Balron, you must *think* like one. Coldly. Precisely. Without pity.</line>
    <line>I mapped their habits, their rituals… even their silences. Knowledge is my sword.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Balrons don’t burn. They *are* the flame. Ancient, endless, cruel.</line>
    <line>Their fire speaks. It whispers names, truths, regrets. Don’t listen.</line>
    <line>They scorch the world not for need, but for *art*. Arson as opera.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="slay" itemType="KillQuestScroll" ctorArgs="Balron,1,12000">
    <line>You want truth? You’ll find it in the ashes of a slain Balron. Kill one — and *know*.</line>
    <line>Words are meaningless unless backed by blood. Slay a Balron. Then we’ll speak as equals.</line>
    <line>Take this scroll. Find a Balron. Bury it. And return to me with a lighter soul.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- RED HERRINGS & LORE FLAVOR -->

  <entry keyword="soul">
    <line>They don’t *steal* souls. They reflect them — warped and burning.</line>
    <line>A Balron looks at your soul like a merchant inspecting goods.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="abyss">
    <line>The deeper the abyss, the louder the screams. But Balrons? They hum.</line>
    <line>I fell into the abyss once. Crawled out with scars shaped like glyphs.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eyes">
    <line>Look into their eyes — if you want to lose yourself.</line>
    <line>Their eyes don’t glow. They burn with memory.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>Balron blood isn’t red. It’s black, like burnt truth.</line>
    <line>Their blood boils not from heat — but from rage.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mercy">
    <line>They understand mercy. That’s why they rarely show it.</line>
    <line>Mercy from a Balron? That’s the cruelest cut of all.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flame">
    <line>Balron flame clings. To armor. To memory. To dreams.</line>
    <line>Fire is their fingerprint. Every village they’ve touched still smolders in myth.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="truth">
    <line>They know truths you should never hear. That’s why they whisper.</line>
    <line>Truth is a blade in a Balron’s hands. Don’t ask for it unless you want to bleed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="horns">
    <line>Their horns aren’t bone. They’re *will* given form.</line>
    <line>One Balron horn on my wall. I touch it every night to remind myself I can win.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="voice">
    <line>Their voice isn’t heard. It’s *felt*. In marrow. In memory.</line>
    <line>The first time a Balron spoke to me, I aged a year. Maybe more.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>Balrons are born in ritual. Forged, not birthed.</line>
    <line>Ritual binds them. And sometimes frees them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fear">
    <line>Fear is the altar they demand you kneel on.</line>
    <line>They don’t eat fear. They *plant* it, then harvest when it flowers.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="name">
    <line>I’ve studied the names they once bore. Speaking them tastes like blood.</line>
    <line>Their true names are gone. They burned them to be free.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ash">
    <line>Everything they touch becomes ash — not just matter, but meaning.</line>
    <line>I’ve sifted Balron ash. Found teeth, bone... and once, something whispering.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glyph">
    <line>Their skin bears glyphs older than speech. I’ve traced them. I don’t sleep well now.</line>
    <line>I copied a glyph from one’s arm once. My ink boiled off the page.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="survivor">
    <line>I survived them once. Not sure I was the lucky one.</line>
    <line>Survival isn’t triumph. It’s a curse they brand you with.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>A Balron passed by a mirror once. The glass didn’t crack. It screamed.</line>
    <line>Don’t hold a mirror near them. You might see *yourself* the way they do.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>They visit dreams like royalty. And they *never* knock.</line>
    <line>I had a dream where one sat beside me. When I woke, half my hair was white.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="symbol">
    <line>They wear no symbols. *They* are the symbol. Of domination.</line>
    <line>I once saw a Balron flinch at a rune. I burned that rune into my gauntlet.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="curse">
    <line>Balrons don’t cast curses. They *become* them.</line>
    <line>To speak their name with hate is to curse yourself in kind.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Their shadow falls ahead of them, as if time itself warns you.</line>
    <line>If you feel a chill and see no source, the Balron is close. Or you’re already dead.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silence">
    <line>It’s not the roar you fear. It’s when they go silent.</line>
    <line>Their silence is the sound of decisions being made. Terrible ones.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="light">
    <line>They don’t emit light. They *steal* it. And joy with it.</line>
    <line>Balrons unmake light. One stepped into my torch’s glow once — and it fled.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mark">
    <line>They marked me once. Not physically. The kind of mark only the soul feels.</line>
    <line>Sometimes I wake up and the mark burns again. That’s when I know it’s near.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="obsession">
    <line>You think I’m obsessed? Then you’ve never heard one laugh.</line>
    <line>Obsession is survival. It’s the armor I wear while remembering.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fireplace">
    <line>I can’t sit near fireplaces. The crackle reminds me of their breath.</line>
    <line>Fire should warm. Now, it only warns me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="book">
    <line>I burned the last book I found on them. It tried to finish reading *me*.</line>
    <line>Some books on demons bleed if you cut them. That’s how you know they’re real.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="voice">
    <line>I’ve heard their voice echo through stone. The stone *wept*.</line>
    <line>The voice of a Balron doesn’t fade. It waits.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="laughter">
    <line>They laugh like thunder through bone. I still hear it when I blink.</line>
    <line>One laughed when I begged. Not because I was weak — but because I was honest.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>When they approach, the wind changes. Tastes like burnt copper.</line>
    <line>No wind near a Balron. Air gets scared, too.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>Every scar I have speaks a sentence in their tongue.</line>
    <line>This one? A wing tip. That one? Regret.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smoke">
    <line>Their smoke doesn’t rise — it *sinks*, like it wants to smother roots.</line>
    <line>In their smoke, you see things. Old things. Wrong things.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grave">
    <line>I dug a grave for one once. Just to believe it was real.</line>
    <line>A Balron deserves no grave. Only forgetting.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fear">
    <line>Fear isn’t the reaction. It’s the *currency* they spend.</line>
    <line>You won’t fear them first. You’ll admire them. That’s the trap.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="portal">
    <line>Balrons don’t walk through portals. They tear holes. The world bleeds when they travel.</line>
    <line>I found a closed portal once — still weeping light, and screaming faintly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="horn">
    <line>I kept a Balron horn once. It throbbed when the moon rose.</line>
    <line>They don’t shed their horns. They grow them for *witnesses*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="regret">
    <line>I don’t regret the hunt. I regret surviving long enough to start it.</line>
    <line>Regret is a mirror. And mine always shows their face.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wings">
    <line>Their wings don’t lift them — they *carry* storm.</line>
    <line>When you see their wings shadow the ground, you have one chance: pray. Or run.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="respect">
    <line>I respect them like I respect a blade. Beautiful. Deadly. Not to be trusted.</line>
    <line>Some say respect your enemy. I say *endure* them — then end them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>I am a scholar of the Battle Chicken Lizard. Yes, *those* feathered fiends.</line>
    <line>My life's work is studying Battle Chickens—creatures of elegance and war. But mostly war.</line>
    <line>I observe, document, and—on occasion—scream at Battle Chickens from a safe distance.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="battle chicken">
    <line>Magnificent beasts. Feathered fury. Talons like barbed shears and eyes full of spite.</line>
    <line>Their combat instincts are flawless. Their loyalty? Questionable at best. Treacherous at worst.</line>
    <line>Once, one bowed to me in the arena. I thought it accepted me. Then it pecked through my kneecap.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>They preen before combat. A sign of vanity. Or bloodlust. Possibly both.</line>
    <line>Roost high, strike low. I've seen them leap from rafters like feathery demons.</line>
    <line>They favor ambushes and group dominance rituals. Like scholars. Only deadlier.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weakness">
    <line>They hate loud noises. A thunderclap can scatter them—briefly.</line>
    <line>Their pride is their flaw. Taunt one, and it loses all tactical sense. Just... don’t miss.</line>
    <line>Get under them. Their underbellies are less armored. And they HATE it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="revenge">
    <line>One betrayed me in the Grand Pit. I raised it. Named it. Now I name all of them: Enemy.</line>
    <line>It wasn't just a betrayal. It was betrayal with choreography. Mid-spin, mid-strike.</line>
    <line>Revenge is not scientific. But it's deeply, deeply satisfying.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="slay" itemType="KillQuestScroll" ctorArgs="BattleChickenLizard,12,7500">
    <line>You want to help? Slay twelve of the beasts. For science. For balance. For my knee.</line>
    <line>Kill twelve Battle Chicken Lizards. Not thirteen. Twelve. Thirteen is *its* number.</line>
    <line>Here—take this scroll. Let it guide you. Bring clarity to the battlefield, and peace to my lab.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Flavor & Red Herrings -->

  <entry keyword="arena">
    <line>They dance in the pit like feathered gladiators. The crowd loves it. I do not.</line>
    <line>The arena changes them. Makes them violent. Also makes them winners. Curse their technique.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feathers">
    <line>Their feathers shimmer with oil and pride. Don't let the beauty fool you.</line>
    <line>I kept one of its feathers. It hums at night. I do not sleep well.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eggs">
    <line>Battle Chicken eggs are priceless. Also booby-trapped. I lost an apprentice to one. Scrambled.</line>
    <line>I tried incubating one once. The result? Speed, fury, and broken furniture.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="peck">
    <line>Their pecking drills armor. I once saw one pierce plate mail in three taps.</line>
    <line>They don’t peck to wound. They peck to *demonstrate*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tail">
    <line>That stubby tail? It's a counterbalance for aerial assault. Also useful for knocking over mugs.</line>
    <line>I once grabbed one by the tail. It spun, screamed, and launched me into a chicken coop.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vengeance">
    <line>Some seek glory. Others, coin. I seek vengeance... wrapped in feathers and blood.</line>
    <line>They remember faces. I hope they remember mine. And flinch.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glory">
    <line>They don’t fight for food or territory. They fight for *style*. That’s what makes them dangerous.</line>
    <line>The Battle Chicken cares not for survival. Only victory. And posing.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="biology">
    <line>Four-chambered hearts. Double wishbones. Serrated beak ridges. Horrifyingly efficient.</line>
    <line>Their physiology is a masterpiece of engineered violence. I admire it. I hate it. It's complicated.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="claw">
    <line>Each claw is like a curved dagger. Filed naturally. Sharpened with contempt.</line>
    <line>I measured one claw. Eight inches. It tapped Morse code on my armor. I didn’t like the message.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scream">
    <line>Their scream is not fear. It’s declaration. A war cry from a beak.</line>
    <line>Heard one scream once and a horse dropped dead. Coincidence? I’m unsure.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="training">
    <line>You don’t train a Battle Chicken. You negotiate. Then regret.</line>
    <line>One learned to dodge fireballs. Not trained—*learned*. From watching me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="diet">
    <line>Carnivorous, omnivorous, and curious. They eat what they kill. Or what annoys them.</line>
    <line>They consumed an entire scroll case once. Then recited part of the spell while pecking me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wings">
    <line>Stubby wings, yet powerful. Like they’ve got vendettas built into the bones.</line>
    <line>They flap when agitated. Also when pleased. Either way, something’s getting hit.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eyes">
    <line>Beady little things. Black. Reflective. Like portals to judgment.</line>
    <line>One stared at me for nine minutes once. I blinked first. Still haunts me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="talent">
    <line>Their true talent is psychological warfare. You laugh—until they *stare*.</line>
    <line>They understand competition. And pettiness. Terrible combination.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="roost">
    <line>They roost on high shelves, then leap like feathery gods of wrath.</line>
    <line>If you hear cooing above you—run. Or kneel. Either works.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bite">
    <line>They don’t need teeth. Their bite still hurts. Emotionally, too.</line>
    <line>They bit through my research notes. Then strutted like it published something.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="alchemy">
    <line>Battle Chicken feathers are alchemically reactive. Especially under moonlight. Why? Ask the ashes of my lab.</line>
    <line>Some try to brew potions with their droppings. Those people are missing now.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smell">
    <line>They smell faintly of ash, adrenaline, and judgment.</line>
    <line>A mix of burned straw, regret, and lavender. Don’t ask me why. It’s always lavender.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boots">
    <line>My boots are reinforced with anti-pecking plates. Doesn’t help much. But I pretend.</line>
    <line>I once wore chicken-hide boots. One Battle Chicken screamed for five hours straight.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="intelligence">
    <line>Battle Chickens solve mazes, recognize faces, and hold grudges. That’s three more traits than most kings.</line>
    <line>One understood sarcasm. I didn’t even *know* I was being mocked at first.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>They circle before battle. Not superstition—pre-calculation.</line>
    <line>Some scholars say their rituals summon luck. I think it summons ego.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mount">
    <line>Tried riding one. Once. It *reversed* the saddle mid-charge.</line>
    <line>Yes, you can mount one. No, you can’t survive it twice.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="poop">
    <line>Battle Chicken droppings can corrode iron. I learned that the hard way. And the smelly way.</line>
    <line>They defecate strategically. On maps. On beds. On egos.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>Battle Chickens respond to music. Especially angry lute solos.</line>
    <line>A bard once played a dirge and the Chicken started dueling the conductor. Beautiful, in a tragic way.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bard">
    <line>Bards love Battle Chickens. Sing about them constantly. Also lose fingers constantly.</line>
    <line>A bard once tried to serenade a nest. I say ‘tried’ because there’s no word for what happened next.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dance">
    <line>They dance before combat. Not for joy—for intimidation.</line>
    <line>Battle Chicken dances are banned in three duchies. Too many duels broke out.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="temper">
    <line>Short-tempered. Long-memory. Terrible combo in a creature that can fly and stab.</line>
    <line>They once declared war on a mirror. Won.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grooming">
    <line>They preen obsessively. It’s not vanity. It’s preparation for chaos.</line>
    <line>If one starts grooming mid-battle, duck. That’s the kill signal.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="betrayal">
    <line>It bowed. I wept. Then it lunged. My assistant clapped. She's gone now too.</line>
    <line>It knew. It *knew* it would hurt me more by hesitating first.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="science">
    <line>Science demands objectivity. I abandoned that after the fifth mauling.</line>
    <line>Every scar is data. Every vendetta, a hypothesis tested in blood.</line>

    <line>Ah! You know of the sacred bat wing? Rare is the soul who sees beyond the flap and into the essence.</line>
    <line>Bat wings—misunderstood by most, revered by the few. Have you considered their arcane resonance?</line>
    <line>A fellow admirer of bat wings? Excellent. Then we may discuss their resonance...</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="resonance">
    <line>The resonance of a bat wing, when properly distilled, can amplify spell matrices. Ever heard of echo binding?</line>
    <line>Resonance is the heartbeat of matter. The bat wing sings in frequencies unknown. Shall we speak of echo binding?</line>
    <line>A keen ear might detect the echo. The next step? Echo binding, of course.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo binding">
    <line>Echo binding is the process of tethering sound to substance. It’s crucial in necromantic stabilizers. Curious about necromancy?</line>
    <line>To bind echoes is to stitch whispers into form. This ties deeply into necromantic principles. Interested?</line>
    <line>The art of echo binding opens doors to necromancy itself. Care to step through?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="necromancy">
    <line>Necromancy is not death—it is the *movement* of death. Energy, recycled. Let’s talk reagents, shall we?</line>
    <line>Many fear necromancy, but truly, it's reagent science. Bat wings play a starring role.</line>
    <line>Where others see taboo, I see reagents—especially bat wings. Interested in other reagents?</line>

  <entry keyword="reagents">
    <line>From mandrake to sulfur ash, all are ingredients in the grand recipe. But none so elegant as the bat wing. Ever used one in a ritual?</line>
    <line>Each reagent hums its own song. The bat wing? A nocturne of the void. Would you like to discuss ritual use?</line>
    <line>Yes, reagents are power. Ritual use, especially of bat wings, reveals their full potential.</line>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>Rituals require precision—and essence. I always keep a pouch of bat wings nearby. But I’m running low...</line>
    <line>The proper ritual, with bat wing in hand, can open sealed pathways. Alas, I’m running dreadfully low.</line>

    <line>Most flee from bats. I study them. Did you know they navigate by sound? Fascinating echolocation.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echolocation">
    <line>Echolocation is the language of darkness. Imagine if we could translate it. Ever thought of sonar magic?</line>
    <line>Sound as sight—that’s echolocation. A perfect concept for developing sonar-based incantations.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sonar">
    <line>Sonar is sound made visible. With the right incantation, you could detect movement through walls!</line>
    <line>Some mages whisper of sonar spells. Others dismiss it as folly. I say it’s untapped potential.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="walls">
    <line>Walls? Hah! With the right formula, even stone yields to sound. Or shadow magic.</line>
    <line>The key to walls is knowing what passes *through* them. That, and a bit of shadow craft.</line>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>The moon governs tides, madness, and the mating calls of cave lizards. Strange, isn’t it?</line>
    <line>Some say the moon is a mirror for the soul. Others say it’s just a hollow egg. I'm undecided.</line>

    <line>Feathers are too light for alchemy—though I once tried distilling owl wisdom from one.</line>
    <line>Feathers are the lies of wings. Give me leather and bone any day.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="leather">
    <line>Bat wings are made of leather, technically. Soft, durable, delightfully morbid.</line>
    <line>The texture of wing-leather—smooth but fibrous. It’s an underrated reagent.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="alchemy">
    <line>Alchemy isn’t about gold. It’s about *understanding*—and sometimes fire.</line>
    <line>They all want to make gold. I want to make silence... in a bottle.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silence">
    <line>Silence is loud if you know how to listen. Especially in caves. Have you been to Black Hollow?</line>
    <line>I once captured silence in a jar. Lost it when someone sneezed near the cork.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="jar">
    <line>A jar is only as good as its seal. I once trapped a scream in one—it escaped when I dropped it.</line>
    <line>I label my jars with dreams. They stay fresher that way.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whispers">
    <line>Whispers are like wind—directionless, but they always carry something.</line>
    <line>A whisper heard from the wrong mouth can change your life. Or end it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mushrooms">
    <line>Ah, mushrooms—the language of the forest floor. I once spoke to a violet cap for three hours.</line>
    <line>Fungi have opinions. You just have to *chew* them slowly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>Bat ink is too viscous. Squid ink is passable. Shadow ink? Now we’re talking.</line>
    <line>Ink is the blood of ideas. Choose your vial wisely.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vial">
    <line>Never trust a clear vial. If it's see-through, it's hiding something.</line>
    <line>I once mistook a health elixir for vinegar. Now I sparkle slightly under moonlight.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bone">
    <line>Bones are memory made solid. That’s why I whisper apologies before grinding them.</line>
    <line>Bat bones are brittle, but they hum with residual echo. Try sleeping next to one sometime.</line>

  <entry keyword="familiar">
    <line>My last familiar was a moth. Smart, but emotionally unavailable.</line>
    <line>Familiars choose *you*, not the other way around. Mine likes to steal buttons.</line>

    <line>It smells like destiny and burnt licorice. Not unpleasant, really.</line>

  <entry keyword="prism">
    <line>A prism splits light. But can it unify shadow? That’s the question. Some say yes.</line>
    <line>Split the light, unify the dark. Prism theory is far deeper than alchemists admit.</line>

    <line>A bead without glass is like a story without a voice. Let’s speak of color...</line>

  <entry keyword="color">
    <line>Color gives beads their emotions—red for passion, blue for wisdom, green for healing.</line>
    <line>Each color hums with intent. But color alone is chaos without pattern.</line>
    <line>Beads speak in color—but listen to their patterns to know their purpose.</line>

  <entry keyword="pattern">
    <line>Patterns are prayers in motion. Every strand a ritual. Do you know the prayer beads?</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="prayer">
    <line>Prayer beads calm the storm within. Focus is their power.</line>
    <line>A bead passed between fingers during prayer channels thought into action. We call that focus.</line>
    <line>Prayer is the silent breath of the soul—and focus its form.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="focus">
    <line>Focus brings stillness, and in stillness, vibration begins.</line>
    <line>To focus on a bead is to hear its hum—its vibration in the world’s rhythm.</line>

  <entry keyword="vibration">
    <line>All things vibrate—beads just help us listen. Their resonance holds secrets.</line>

    <line>Vibration becomes resonance when intention aligns. Shall we speak of resonance?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="resonance">
    <line>When resonance is pure, the bead gives more than it takes. It becomes a gift.</line>

    <line>Structure gives shape to meaning... or cages it. I wonder about knots. Do you?</line>
    <line>Structure without soul is just a pattern. Maybe knots know better.</line>

    <line>Knots are secrets in silk. One twist can hold, another can bind. Ever tried untying one soaked in oil?</line>
    <line>Knots tell more than maps. Ask a sailor—or a monk.</line>

    <line>Sailors use beads to count leagues. Or so I’ve heard. But beads mean more on land.</line>

    <line>The market is full of cheap beads, loud voices, and louder opinions.</line>
    <line>I once found a single perfect bead buried beneath a crate of cabbage. Luck? Or destiny?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cabbage">
    <line>Cabbage has layers, like people. Not unlike beadwork, really.</line>
    <line>Funny thing—cabbage and beads smell the same after a rainstorm. Don’t ask why, just notice.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>If a merchant tells you a bead is 'blessed by a wind spirit,' check for paint first.</line>

    <line>What is blessing but belief wrapped in repetition?</line>
    <line>Some call their beads blessed. Others just rinse them in river water and call it good.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="river">
    <line>Rivers polish beads of stone over centuries. We do it with tools. Same result, less poetry.</line>
    <line>I lost a whole pouch of beads to a river once. They’re probably still downstream, teaching fish about art.</line>

  <entry keyword="fish">
    <line>Fish have no use for beads. They have scales already, after all.</line>

    <line>Shiny is not the same as beautiful. Many mistakes have sparkled.</line>
    <line>Some people chase shiny things their whole lives. I prefer weight and warmth.</line>

    <line>Each bead remembers the fingers that passed it, the breath that blessed it.</line>
    <line>Memories are beads on the string of time. Most of mine are tangled.</line>

  <entry keyword="string of time">
    <line>The string of time frays at the ends. Tie it tight, or the moments will slip.</line>
    <line>Some say fate is a string, others a wheel. I think it’s just a knot no one can untie.</line>

    <line>Knots can bind or protect. Depends on the intention behind the twist.</line>
    <line>The tighter the knot, the more it wants to be remembered.</line>

    <line>A friend of mine was colorblind. Said texture mattered more. That changed how I work.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>They roam dusk and dawn. Twilight hunters. Twilight murderers.</line>
    <line>A brown bear will circle a camp for hours before striking. They know patience. It terrifies me.</line>

    <line>They shed in clumps. Found a clump once bigger than a dog. Still warm.</line>

  <entry keyword="roar">
    <line>Their roar isn’t a threat. It’s a warning—to everything else: ‘This is mine.’</line>

    <line>Each claw’s a dagger curved by time. They don’t stab. They *rip*.</line>

    <line>Bears don't have animal eyes. They have *memories*. I saw mine in a bear’s gaze once. It blinked last.</line>

    <line>The forest is their kingdom. They rule by claw and silence.</line>
    <line>You want to respect the forest? Understand who holds its leash. Brown bears do.</line>

    <line>This isn’t just justice. It’s remembering the screams—and making sure the trees don’t echo them again.</line>
    <line>Every bear I slay brings me closer to forgetting that day. I don’t think I ever will.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tracks">
    <line>Large prints. Five toes. Deeper on one side—they favor their right paw when stalking.</line>
    <line>Tracks that disappear? That’s worse. Means it’s nearby—and watching.</line>

  <entry keyword="hibernation">
    <line>They don’t truly sleep. They *wait*. You disturb a hibernating bear, you don’t wake it—you end yourself.</line>

  <entry keyword="breath">
    <line>Bear breath smells like old meat and fear. You’ll know it if you ever feel it on your neck.</line>

  <entry keyword="mother">
    <line>Never, *ever*, approach a sow with cubs. She doesn’t see you—she sees a threat already dead.</line>

  <entry keyword="paw">
    <line>A bear’s paw print can be bigger than a dinner plate. Wider than some faces I’ve buried.</line>
    <line>Saw one once use a single paw to crush a helm. It didn’t even notice it had stepped on something.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rotten">
    <line>They eat rot like kings. Maggots don’t bother them. Why would they? They’ll join them soon enough.</line>
    <line>Rot doesn’t slow them. If anything, it makes them stronger. Hungrier.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feast">
    <line>A bear feast is a horror. Sounds like wet logs breaking. Smells worse.</line>

  <entry keyword="spirit">
    <line>Some tribes say brown bears have spirits. If true, they’re not kind ones.</line>
    <line>A druid once claimed bear spirits protect the forest. I wonder what they were protecting when mine died screaming.</line>

    <line>Bear growls echo wrong. Like the forest itself is angry.</line>
    <line>If you hear a bear growl bounce off rocks—you’re surrounded.</line>

    <line>A growl in the dark can freeze blood. Bears don’t bluff.</line>

    <line>Night is when they walk. Day is just when they sleep off the hunger.</line>
    <line>If you hear nothing in the woods at night — *that's* when you run.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wound">
    <line>Bears don’t leave wounds. They leave *warnings*.</line>
    <line>This scar? That’s from a cub. I never met the mother.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="footprints">
    <line>Black bear tracks are wide, heavy, and too close when you finally notice them.</line>
    <line>If the claw marks are deep and the stride is slow — it’s hunting, not wandering.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pelt">
    <line>Bear pelts fetch gold in cities. But they fetch ghosts in dreams.</line>
    <line>I once skinned a black bear by moonlight. The hide twitched *after* it was off.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grumble">
    <line>Bears grumble before they charge. Like they’re talking it over with themselves.</line>
    <line>If you hear a grumble in the woods — crouch. Don’t breathe. Don’t think. Just crouch.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="winter">
    <line>In winter, black bears sleep. But not deeply. Not enough.</line>
    <line>Their dreams walk the snow, I swear it. I’ve seen pawprints where no bear stood.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eyes">
    <line>Bear eyes aren’t wild — they’re *aware*. Makes you wonder what they remember.</line>
    <line>Look into a bear’s eyes, and you’ll see it judging you. Deciding something.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="growl">
    <line>A growl low enough to shake your gut? That’s not hunger. That’s *recognition*.</line>
    <line>I heard one growl once... but it was behind me. Never did see it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="river">
    <line>Bears love rivers. For fish. For cleaning. For watching travelers slip in.</line>
    <line>If the water smells like fur and fish guts, turn back. Or swim faster.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadows">
    <line>They move like shadows with weight. You don’t see them — you feel them, pressing.</line>
    <line>Sometimes I wake up because the *shadows* felt wrong. That’s how they start.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bones">
    <line>Found a pile of bones once, all cracked open. Bear feeding. Or bear *ritual*.</line>
    <line>Black bears don’t clean their kills. They just sit on the remains like thrones.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smoke">
    <line>They hate smoke. But I’ve seen one walk through a fire just to prove me wrong.</line>
    <line>I lit a fire once, thinking I was safe. It watched from the other side — eyes glowing.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scratches">
    <line>Bear claw scratches on a tree aren’t just marks — they’re *messages*.</line>
    <line>Saw my name once in claw marks. Probably coincidence. Probably.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>They don’t howl at the moon. But they *look* at it like it owes them something.</line>
    <line>Full moon’s when they move faster. Something about the cold light fuels them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>They don’t hibernate. They *wait*. That’s different.</line>
    <line>A sleeping bear isn’t safe. It’s thinking with its eyes closed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tongue">
    <line>Their tongues are rough. Ripped a patch of flesh right off me once — by accident.</line>
    <line>A bear licked my hand once. Thought it was tasting before the bite.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="laugh">
    <line>Bears don’t laugh. But once, I swear one made a sound that *felt* like it.</line>
    <line>It knocked over my tent and snorted. Wasn’t hunger — was *amusement*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>When the wind stops and you smell pine and blood, they’re close.</line>
    <line>Wind tells them where you are. You can't hide sweat from a bear.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ashes">
    <line>I burned a bear once. The next one rolled in the ashes. Like it knew.</line>
    <line>Ashes don’t cover the scent of fear. Bears taught me that.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="talon">
    <line>Some say there's a black bear with talons, not claws. I met it. Barely.</line>
    <line>Talons aren’t natural. That’s what worried me most.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>Every scar I have has a story. Most end with '...and then the bear bit.'</line>
    <line>I show my scars to warn others. Some still go looking. Fools.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scent">
    <line>They smell fear. And berries. And hope.</line>
    <line>If a bear catches your scent, you’ve got three seconds of prayer left.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="roar">
    <line>Black bears rarely roar. When they do—it’s a death sentence, not a warning.</line>
    <line>If you hear a roar and you're still standing, it wasn’t aimed at you... yet.</line>

    <line>I studied insects, once. Wrote scrolls, catalogued wings. Now I study a single pest—over and over.</line>
    <line>My job? I suppose I’m a beetle chronicler. A miserable title for a miserable obsession.</line>

  <entry keyword="beetle">
    <line>Marvels of nature. Armored like knights, silent like assassins.</line>
    <line>The Deathwatch Beetle Hatchling—beautiful and cursed. Its carapace gleams like obsidian regret.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hatchling">
    <line>Tiny, twitchy, tireless. Worse than the adults—they don’t yet know fear.</line>
    <line>A hatchling may seem harmless. Until your tent collapses under a thousand of them.</line>
    <line>They click at night. That’s how they speak. And plan.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="collection">
    <line>Once I held the world’s rarest butterflies. Now I hold ash and chitin.</line>
    <line>My life's work—eaten in a week. Wings torn, bodies shattered, even the frames were chewed.</line>
    <line>I preserved beauty. The hatchlings preferred it crispy.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scrolls">
    <line>They devoured my written works first. As if to erase my knowledge before they ruined my legacy.</line>
    <line>Twenty years of notes... gone in a night of soft clicking. They didn’t just eat the words—they silenced them.</line>
    <line>They prefer old parchment. Oil in the ink? Glue in the bindings? I no longer care. I only burn them now.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vengeance">
    <line>This isn’t study anymore. It’s revenge disguised as research.</line>
    <line>They took my butterflies. So I take their lives. Fair trade.</line>
    <line>Every hatchling I crush is a verse in the poem of my rage.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clicking">
    <line>Their clicking echoes in my dreams. Rhythmic, like a lullaby with teeth.</line>
    <line>Click-click-click—three short bursts before they swarm. I’ve memorized the tempo of fear.</line>
    <line>When the clicking stops, it's worse. That means they're listening.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="kill">
    <line>You want to help? Don’t flatter me. Just crush ten of them. Here. Take this tracker.</line>
    <line>I’ve studied them enough. Now I study how many corpses it takes to feel peace. Slay ten.</line>
    <line>Take this scroll. Hunt ten Deathwatch Beetle Hatchlings. Bring silence back to these woods.</line>

  <!-- Red Herrings & Depth -->

  <entry keyword="shell">
    <line>Their shells are intricately layered. Stronger than iron in some parts, weaker than pride in others.</line>
    <line>Crack the shell, crack the soul. Or so I like to imagine.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="noise">
    <line>They don't speak. They *announce*. A chorus of tiny percussionists heralding ruin.</line>
    <line>I once thought the sound was mating behavior. No—it’s war drums.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Fire works, sometimes. But it stinks. Burning beetle smells like betrayal.</line>
    <line>They scatter in firelight. Not out of fear, but to flank you better.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="legs">
    <line>Six legs. Too many. Not enough. Depends how fast they’re coming.</line>
    <line>Break a leg and they limp. Break three and they fly into your face.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="antennae">
    <line>Their antennae twitch like violin strings. They feel the air, the heat, the hate.</line>
    <line>Snip them off and they lose direction. But gain fury.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="carapace">
    <line>Dark, patterned, chitinous. Some nobles use them in jewelry. I use them in nightmares.</line>
    <line>Polished, it’s beautiful. Bloodied, it’s satisfying.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nest">
    <line>They nest in rot and warmth. Old books, dead trees, backpack seams.</line>
    <line>Find a nest, burn it. Or bury it. Or run. I’ve done all three.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="enemy">
    <line>You ask who my enemy is. I’d say time. But no—it’s the hatchlings.</line>
    <line>I named each beetle I killed. Then I stopped. Too many names. Too much hate.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dust">
    <line>They leave behind a fine dust. Tastes of mildew and regret. Don’t ask how I know.</line>
    <line>Every hatchling leaves a dust trail. Follow it, and you follow madness.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>I once saw a swarm blot out the sun. Briefly. Beautifully. Horrifyingly.</line>
    <line>Their shadows flicker like candlelight before the burn.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>I held one up to a mirror once. It turned away. Even beetles have shame.</line>
    <line>Reflections confuse them. Or maybe they just hate their own form. Like I do.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>Beetles love ink. Suck it from the page like marrow from bone.</line>
    <line>They ruined my lexicon. Ink and all. Devoured the word ‘peace’ first, I noticed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cage">
    <line>Tried keeping one in a cage. It escaped. Left me a shell and a warning.</line>
    <line>Cages are a suggestion to them. And not a polite one.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bite">
    <line>They don't bite to feed. They bite to test. To measure your worth.</line>
    <line>I’d rather be bitten by a bear. At least that ends quickly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dreams">
    <line>I dream in carapace and clicking now. Sleep offers no escape—just deeper taxonomy.</line>
    <line>Sometimes I dream I'm one of them. Six legs, no heart, endless hunger.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>The sound of them scraping their legs... it’s almost musical. Like a lullaby written in madness.</line>
    <line>Some fools play beetle clicking in bard colleges. 'Deathwatch Waltz', they call it. They don't know it’s a warning.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smoke">
    <line>Tried smoke once. Drove them out—but into my tent. Lesson learned.</line>
    <line>They hate smoke, but they learn fast. The second swarm brought goggles.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hole">
    <line>Found one living in my boot. Dug a perfect hole. Slept there like a tenant.</line>
    <line>They burrow through canvas, wood, pride—anything soft, really.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="food">
    <line>They don’t eat to live. They eat to erase.</line>
    <line>Left a loaf of bread out. Came back, it was hollow. Still warm. Still moving.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feast">
    <line>A beetle feast is a silent thing. Except for the crunching. That part's unforgettable.</line>
    <line>They gather for a feast when the moon wanes. Don't ask how I know. Don’t ask where I watched from.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feathers">
    <line>They hate feathers. Something about the texture. Maybe it reminds them of wings they'll never have.</line>
    <line>Feathers confuse them. I wear them in my hat. Only reason I still have a head.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silk">
    <line>Beetles adore silk. Not for taste—for ruin. They shred it like paper dreams.</line>
    <line>Had a silk robe once. Wore it into the woods. Left with threadbare shame and a lot of itching.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="decay">
    <line>They love decay. It’s warmth to them. Memory to us.</line>
    <line>If something smells like rot, assume the beetles are near—or you’re about to join them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boots">
    <line>My boots squish now. Always. Even on dry ground. I’m never sure what I’ve stepped in.</line>
    <line>Stepped on one once. Crunch echoed for minutes. Then the others came.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="alcohol">
    <line>I soaked one in wine once. It got faster. And meaner.</line>
    <line>Some swear beetle parts steeped in mead cure coughs. Those people are dead now. Or worse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>Under a waning moon, they gather. Why? Don’t know. Don’t want to.</line>
    <line>Their shells reflect moonlight like armor. Saw my face once. Didn't like what I saw.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>Their blood isn’t red. It's gray and oily. Smells like burnt dreams.</line>
    <line>One bled on my notes once. The ink dissolved. The meaning too.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pouch">
    <line>Never keep dried meat in your pouch around beetles. Unless you want a hole where your pouch used to be.</line>
    <line>Lost a pouch to them. Leather, thread, dreams—gone in minutes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="potion">
    <line>Alchemists say beetle bile has magical properties. I say it’s just acidic and rude.</line>
    <line>I drank one once. Mistook it for healing. Burned for a week. Saw truth, though. The beetles must die.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="friend">
    <line>I had friends. They laughed at my beetle warnings. The clicking got them first.</line>
    <line>Beetles make poor friends. But excellent excuses to avoid company.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="obsession">
    <line>Some call this obsession. I call it cleansing. Same motions, different motivations.</line>
    <line>You don’t *study* beetles this long without becoming part beetle. Click once if you agree.</line>

    <line>Entomologist. Historian. Slayer. Depends on the day — and the beetle.</line>
    <line>I study beetles. Their armor, their instincts, their monstrous elegance.</line>
    <line>I once called them nature’s jewel boxes. Now? I call them prey.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="beetle">
    <line>They wear their skeletons outside. Nature’s little tanks, polished by dirt and death.</line>
    <line>Beetles are ancient. Survivors of countless extinctions. I aim to make them fail the next one.</line>
    <line>A beetle doesn’t kill for food. It kills to make space. Know your enemy.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="armor">
    <line>Chitin—tougher than boiled leather. Beautiful in sunlight. Horrible when it's the last thing you see.</line>
    <line>I kept a beetle shell once. Now I smash them flat before they can glisten.</line>
    <line>Their armor isn't perfect. Strike the underbelly. Or use fire. Or both.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="swarm">
    <line>A lone beetle is a curiosity. A swarm is an ending.</line>
    <line>They don’t fight alone. They come in waves. Waves with legs and hunger.</line>
    <line>Ever hear a swarm eat a man? Sounds like dry leaves, until the screaming starts.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="obsession">
    <line>I studied beetles for twenty years. Now I kill them with the same precision.</line>
    <line>My obsession made me blind. It also made me their perfect executioner.</line>
    <line>Love something too long and it becomes part of you. Hate something just as long—it becomes your purpose.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wife">
    <line>She said they were lovely. She was half-right. Now she’s half-buried in a swarm nest.</line>
    <line>My wife believed in harmony with nature. The beetles taught me nature doesn’t care.</line>
    <line>They took her. I take them. It’s not justice. It’s arithmetic.</line>

    <line>I used to polish chitin samples. Now I grind them into dust.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nest">
    <line>Find the nests, burn them. Before they hatch. Or after. Doesn’t matter.</line>
    <line>A beetle nest smells like fungus and sorrow. You’ll know it when you gag.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clicking">
    <line>They click to communicate. To threaten. To celebrate. I’ve learned their morse code of murder.</line>
    <line>If you hear clicking, draw your blade. If it stops... you’re too late.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="antennae">
    <line>Antennae aren’t for show. They read the air, the ground, the fear in your breath.</line>
    <line>Break a beetle’s antennae and you blind it. Only briefly, but sometimes that’s all you need.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="carapace">
    <line>Underneath that shell is meat. Angry, armored meat.</line>
    <line>Crack the carapace and the beetle dies ashamed. It loves its shell more than its life.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="symbols">
    <line>Ancient runes show beetles as guides to the afterlife. After what they did, I call that a joke.</line>
    <line>Once sacred in desert tombs. Now sacred only to my sword.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Fire curls the shell, softens the scream. It’s mercy, really.</line>
    <line>Beetles hate fire. But they burn beautifully. Smells like roasted evil.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dung">
    <line>Not all beetles roll dung. But the ones that do? They’re proud about it.</line>
    <line>Dung beetles are harmless. It's their cousins you should fear.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="books">
    <line>I wrote three volumes on beetle morphology. Now I write names in their blood.</line>
    <line>The best books on beetles are written in sweat and steel, not ink.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shell">
    <line>I kept one once. Polished. Prized. Now I crush them underfoot.</line>
    <line>Beetle shells don’t break easy. But everything breaks, eventually.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="larva">
    <line>Beetle larvae are pale, wriggling lies. Soft now, armored later.</line>
    <line>The larvae don’t bite. They wait. Which is worse, somehow.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mandibles">
    <line>Their jaws are sharp enough to sever tendon. I still limp.</line>
    <line>Mandibles don’t just cut — they *hold*. That’s when panic sets in.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="desert">
    <line>In the dunes, beetles draw sacred symbols with their trails. Or warnings. Hard to say.</line>
    <line>Desert beetles bury themselves by the thousands. The sand remembers their hunger.</line>

    <line>I used to be a collector. Now I’m an exterminator. Life is change.</line>
    <line>I still have pinned specimens. Tiny coffins behind glass.</line>

    <line>The scarab's shine hides rot. Like a polished lie.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>Their shells reflect your face as they kill you. That’s poetry. Cruel, cruel poetry.</line>
    <line>Once I saw my own reflection in one’s carapace — right before it bit me. Woke up two days later.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="claw">
    <line>They don't have claws. They *become* claws. Nature made them into tools of war.</line>
    <line>The claw isn't the danger. It's the silence before it grabs you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="underground">
    <line>They nest deep, where torchlight fades. Some say they dream there.</line>
    <line>The tunnels below hum with beetle movement. I’ve mapped them. I regret it.</line>

    <line>They visit me in sleep. Clicking. Clicking. Always closer.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pincers">
    <line>Some beetles use pincers for mating displays. Others for decapitation. Nature’s funny like that.</line>
    <line>I once mistook pincers for twigs. Still have the scar on my wrist.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>Some tribes summon beetles in rituals. That’s not faith. That’s doom.</line>
    <line>The old rites involved beetle oil and chanting. I won’t repeat the words.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>Their movement creates rhythm. Some say it’s music. Some say madness.</line>
    <line>I recorded their clicking once. Played it back. Something else clicked *back*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="collector's guild">
    <line>They banned me after the fire. Said I was unstable. They're not wrong.</line>
    <line>The guild wanted samples. I brought corpses. They weren't ready for the truth.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="plague">
    <line>In some lands, beetles bring rot. Not disease — just *change* that stinks.</line>
    <line>A swarm once swept through a farming town. Left behind husks and silence.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wings">
    <line>Wings hidden beneath plates — elegant, deceptive. Like a lie with feathers.</line>
    <line>Their wings are brittle. Snap them and they drop like regrets.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tongue">
    <line>Some have rasping tongues. Scrape the skin until it peels. Not a metaphor.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen a beetle taste a stone, then bite through it. Imagine what it does to flesh.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scent">
    <line>They emit a musk when threatened. Smells like metal and mold. Lingers for days.</line>
    <line>A beetle's scent is a warning to others. To me, it’s a challenge.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scale">
    <line>Beetle scales shimmer like coins. Don’t be fooled — treasure doesn’t bite.</line>
    <line>I saw one glinting under moonlight. Thought it was gold. It wasn’t. It moved.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Their backs reflect the moon. Hunters say it’s bad luck to fight them by night.</line>
    <line>I caught my own gaze in one’s shell once. Looked away. It didn’t.</line>

    <line>Every tick means they’re near. Counting down. To what? Doesn’t matter. Kill them before the silence.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hive">
    <line>They build hives in dead trees, hollow bones… and abandoned homes. I’ve found them in coffins.</line>
    <line>The hive minds them. Commands them. You burn one hive, another grows somewhere darker.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="betrayal">
    <line>I trusted them. Bred them. Named the first queen Silex. She bit my hand off. That's gratitude.</line>
    <line>I gave them everything. Shelter. Wisdom. Then they devoured my apprentice. Left only her robes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="queen">
    <line>The queen’s carapace is gold-veined, thick as shields. She lays a hundred eggs a day.</line>
    <line>Kill the queen, and the hive scatters. For a time. Until another hatches… or returns.</line>

  <entry keyword="insect">
    <line>Not all insects deserve death. Just the ones that whisper your name at night.</line>
    <line>Spiders weave. Bees serve. Beetles? Beetles conquer.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="carapace">
    <line>Their shells are impervious to most blades. But brittle beneath fire or frost.</line>
    <line>Crack the carapace, and you’ll hear a hiss — not breath. It’s anger escaping.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Fire slows them. Doesn't kill them. Not always. I’ve seen them burn… and keep crawling.</line>
    <line>I doused a hive in oil once. Burned it. They screamed. That haunts me more than the ticking.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="click">
    <line>Click-click-click… like bones knocking together. It’s how they talk. Or pray.</line>
    <line>If you hear clicking behind a wall — run. Or light it up.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mandible">
    <line>Their mandibles are strong enough to shear plate. I keep one on my belt as a reminder.</line>
    <line>One mandible clamped my arm. The second one took it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="apprentice">
    <line>Her name was Merrin. She loved the beetles more than I did. They loved her… differently.</line>
    <line>She fed them by hand. Laughed when they clicked. Then one day they clicked… and lunged.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="regret">
    <line>They were my life’s work. My pride. Now they’re my shame.</line>
    <line>Every beetle I kill is a page torn from my journal. I do it anyway.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="armor">
    <line>I once fashioned armor from beetle shell. Lightweight. Resilient. Now I burn every piece I find.</line>
    <line>A merchant offered me gold for beetle-plate. I gave him a nest instead.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silex">
    <line>Silex was the first queen. Clever, curious… cruel. I wonder if she still remembers me.</line>
    <line>She watched me through the glass with eyes that never blinked. Then the glass shattered.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glass">
    <line>I kept them behind enchanted glass. It cracked. I still don’t know how.</line>
    <line>Glass holds nothing forever. Especially secrets. Or beetles.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="burrow">
    <line>They burrow not just through dirt — but wood, bone, and stone. I lost a cottage that way.</line>
    <line>If the ground shivers, they're below. Pray they stay there.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dust">
    <line>Beetles leave dust behind — ground shell, dried skin. Look close. It’s their history.</line>
    <line>Found dust on my pillow once. Didn’t sleep for a week.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chitin">
    <line>Chitin’s beautiful — like stained glass under the moonlight. Until it cuts you.</line>
    <line>Their chitin grows in rings. Like trees. Like lies.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="decay">
    <line>They don’t cause decay — they *prefer* it. Makes the wood softer. The bones, sweeter.</line>
    <line>Decay sings to them. That’s why crypts go quiet… right before the clicking starts.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="egg">
    <line>One egg looks harmless. A cluster? That’s a problem. They don’t hatch — they *erupt*.</line>
    <line>I once found an egg in my boot. Never wore leather again.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nest">
    <line>A beetle nest isn’t built — it’s eaten into place. They carve their homes with hunger.</line>
    <line>If you find a nest, burn it. Don’t inspect. Don’t think. Just burn.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sawdust">
    <line>Sawdust near your bed? Could be termites. Or beetles. One’s worse. You guess which.</line>
    <line>They chew in spirals — makes the dust fall like snow. Deadly, lovely snow.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="traps">
    <line>I tried snares. Pitfalls. Nothing holds them. But they *notice*. And learn.</line>
    <line>Every trap I’ve made? They’ve escaped. Or worse — dismantled.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>They react to music. Harp tones calm them. Drums? Agitate. I never figured out why.</line>
    <line>Played a lullaby once. They gathered to listen. That was… almost nice. Almost.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smoke">
    <line>Smoke slows their breath. Makes them sluggish. If beetles breathe. Do they?</line>
    <line>Too much smoke and they burrow *up*, not down. Learned that the hard way.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="books">
    <line>I wrote three books on them. None survived the fire. Maybe that’s for the best.</line>
    <line>The last chapter of my journal just says 'Do not trust the Queen'. I don’t remember writing it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="runes">
    <line>I carved protective runes on the doorframe. Didn’t stop them. Now I carve them on everything.</line>
    <line>Some say beetles *read* the runes. Or worse — understand them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vibration">
    <line>Their legs feel every footstep. You’re never sneaking past one.</line>
    <line>They can detect a heartbeat across a stone floor. That’s how they found my cat.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="queenblood">
    <line>Queen blood glows faintly blue. I saw it once. Felt… wrong. Like it hated being seen.</line>
    <line>It doesn’t clot. Just flows. Slow. Like it wants to remember the path it takes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>They avoid mirrors. Or maybe I *only* think they do.</line>
    <line>Reflections don’t lie. Unless the beetle’s behind you. Then they don’t matter.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cocoon">
    <line>Not all beetles hatch from eggs. Some *become* eggs. That’s… a newer problem.</line>
    <line>A cocoon should promise safety. Theirs promise teeth.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clicksong">
    <line>Their ticks aren’t random. They’re language. Sometimes I still hear the songs they made.</line>
    <line>Click. Click. Pause. Click. It meant something. It always meant something.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ash">
    <line>Burn one, and it leaves ash like obsidian flakes. Sharp. Black. Too warm.</line>
    <line>They crumble into ash if you strike just right. Like shattering a secret.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="knock">
    <line>Two knocks on wood — that’s their signal. If you hear three? That’s not them. That’s warning.</line>
    <line>I knock now before I enter any room. Habit. Or fear.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ceiling">
    <line>They love ceilings. No one looks up. Until it’s too late.</line>
    <line>If dust falls and no one’s walking above you… look up. Slowly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glow">
    <line>In moonlight, their shells shimmer. Some say they store the light for later. For hunting.</line>
    <line>I watched one glow in the dark. It blinked like a heartbeat.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>I tried writing their names once. The ink bubbled. The page curled. Never again.</line>
    <line>Some beetles bleed ink. I used to collect it. Then it started writing back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chant">
    <line>There’s a chant the old monks used to keep beetles away. I hum it now and then.</line>
    <line>The chant doesn’t stop them. It just makes their death slower. More confused.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hollow">
    <line>If it sounds hollow, don’t knock. You’re not alone.</line>
    <line>They hollow things from the inside. Sometimes… people.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="path">
    <line>They always follow the same path twice. Once for memory. Once for kill.</line>
    <line>I mapped a beetle’s route once. It made a spiral. Into my house.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grain">
    <line>They hide in grain sacks. Learned that the hard way. Still can’t eat porridge.</line>
    <line>Their larvae love oats. Found one with a jaw like a sickle. In my breakfast.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="candle">
    <line>Candlelight draws them. Maybe warmth. Maybe the flicker. Maybe the shadows it casts.</line>
    <line>If your candle won’t stay lit — don’t check the wick. Check the wall.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pest">
    <line>Call them pests if you like. I once did. Before they called me by name.</line>
    <line>Pests scurry. These… these calculate.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silence">
    <line>Worse than the ticking is the silence after. Like they’re waiting. Listening.</line>
    <line>Silence means they’ve seen you. And they don’t need to tick anymore.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="touch">
    <line>A beetle’s touch is soft. Almost gentle. Like it’s tasting your skin with memory.</line>
    <line>One brushed my hand. I didn’t notice the cut until it whispered.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="footsteps">
    <line>They don't leave footprints. Just scratches. Deep, deliberate ones.</line>
    <line>Sometimes I hear extra footsteps. Behind mine. Never overlapping.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="night">
    <line>They move most at night. When it’s quiet. So you can hear the ticking.</line>
    <line>I haven’t slept well in years. Not since the ticking started beneath my floorboards.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nectar">
    <line>I used to feed them nectar. Now I pour it on traps to lure them in.</line>
    <line>They love sweet things. Especially lies.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clicker">
    <line>That was their name for me, I think — 'Clicker'. I clicked to speak with them. Now I click my sword’s hilt before I draw.</line>
    <line>Clicker… I was proud of that. Now I spit it out like poison.</line>

  <entry keyword="trait">
    <line>No two are quite the same. That’s what makes them maddening. And perfect... in their way.</line>
    <line>They adapt. They change. One even grew a second mouth to whisper lies.</line>

  <entry keyword="hate">
    <line>Hate? Yes. But it is the hate you feel for a reflection twisted and true.</line>
    <line>They ruined my mind before they ever touched my flesh. That’s how they begin—with doubt.</line>

    <line>Silver slows them. Fire confuses them. But they *fear* memory. Their own, or yours.</line>
    <line>They’re clever. You must be cruel. Strike without hesitation. They don’t deserve it—but they expect it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>They shun mirrors. Not because of vanity—but because mirrors remember what they were.</line>
    <line>I caught one staring into a mirror once... it wept. Then screamed. Then vanished.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>Their voices echo. Even when silent. Some say you can hear them under your skin.</line>
    <line>They mimic loved ones. Mothers. Brothers. Your own. Never listen.</line>

  <entry keyword="revenge">
    <line>One wore my lover’s face. And laughed while doing it. That’s why I study them. That’s why I *hunt*.</line>
    <line>This isn’t revenge. This is correction. Purging a broken page from history.</line>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>The ritual that creates them is old. Forbidden. It eats the soul and sculpts the remains.</line>

    <line>The veil thins near midnight. That’s when they cross easiest.</line>

  <entry keyword="lament">

  <entry keyword="truth">
    <line>Ask them for the truth and they’ll offer you a mirror and a scream.</line>

    <line>Owls are the librarians of bird society. They know too much and never blink.</line>
    <line>If you hear an owl hoot thrice, turn around. Or don’t. It’s too late either way.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="guano">
    <line>Bird droppings are more than disgusting. They're strategic. Ever tried dueling with your eyes closed?</line>
    <line>I once mapped their guano patterns. Found a message. Still haunts me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>A bird’s shadow passes over your face, and you *know*—you’ve been marked.</line>
    <line>I flinch at shadows now. Once mistook a falling leaf for a hawk. We don’t talk about what happened next.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="peck">
    <line>Pecking isn’t random. It’s a language. My forearm was once the site of an entire sentence.</line>
    <line>They peck to test your resolve. Fail, and they'll peck again—harder, smugger.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flight">
    <line>Flight was their first lie. They rise not in freedom—but in *defiance.*</line>
    <line>To fly is to escape. I envy them. And I hate them for it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="crumbs">
    <line>Never drop crumbs in front of a bird. It’s not feeding—it’s *summoning.*</line>
    <line>One crumb leads to ten birds. Ten birds lead to madness. I keep my bread sealed in iron tins now.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whistle">
    <line>I once tried to mimic a lark’s whistle. It called *something*... it wasn’t a lark.</line>
    <line>Birds whistle to each other. I’ve learned to whistle back. They do not like that.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="talon">
    <line>Talons are not tools. They are declarations.</line>
    <line>I still have the scar. It spells out a warning in cursive, I think.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="plague">
    <line>Birds carry more than feathers and malice. They carry *omens.*</line>
    <line>Every plague starts with a bird. They sing just before the fever hits.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Birds fear mirrors—or fall in love with them. Either way, they reveal too much.</line>
    <line>I tried leaving a mirror in a rookery once. Next morning, the glass was gone. And so was my tent.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>The wind speaks in birdsong if you listen long enough. I stopped listening after what it said.</line>
    <line>Birds ride the wind like thieves on a current. Stealing silence. Replacing it with chirps.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="color">
    <line>The brighter the feather, the crueler the bird. Beauty’s just a lure for fools.</line>
    <line>One red-feathered beast lured me into a pit trap. *They plan.*</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nesting">
    <line>Nesting season is war season. You approach a nest, you approach *consequence.*</line>
    <line>They nest in chimneys, attics, even skulls. I’ve found all three.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="watch">
    <line>Birds don’t sleep. They *watch.* Even when they pretend to blink.</line>
    <line>There’s always one in sight. You think you’re alone? Look again. Higher.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="beady">
    <line>Beady eyes. No mercy in them. Just calculation.</line>
    <line>A sparrow stared at me once for ten full minutes. Didn’t blink. I moved first. I regret it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="seed">
    <line>They say birds plant the forest. They also destroy it. That’s balance, they say. I call it *spite.*</line>
    <line>A bird once dropped a seed into my boot. Grew roots. Took a week to dig out.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clock">
    <line>A bird lived in my clock for three weeks. I let it stay. Until it reset my chimes to *dawn.*</line>
    <line>Cuckoo clocks are not jokes. They’re warnings.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="language">
    <line>Birds have a language. It’s mostly mockery, but I’ve cracked parts of it.</line>
    <line>I once repeated a call I heard at dusk. Woke up surrounded by angry finches. It means ‘duel,’ apparently.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feast">
    <line>Ever seen birds feast on something they shouldn’t? You’ll understand why I carry salt.</line>
    <line>A feast of feathers is still a feast. I’ve ruined two picnics that way.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="twitch">
    <line>When a bird twitches, it's not random. They're recalibrating. Plotting.</line>
    <line>I twitch back sometimes. Establishes dominance. Or so I hope.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boots">
    <line>My boots are bird-proof. Learned the hard way. Pecked laces are no joke mid-chase.</line>
    <line>I once stepped on a nest. The boots survived. My reputation didn’t.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="map">
    <line>I mapped their flight paths. They form a symbol. Still trying to unsee it.</line>
    <line>Every bird flies with purpose. Some fly in patterns. Some spell curses.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="seed">
    <line>Birds drop seeds as they fly. Planting chaos. Ever tripped on a surprise sunflower? I have.</line>
    <line>Never feed birds. It only encourages them. Then they remember your face.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flock">
    <line>A single bird is a nuisance. A flock is an *incident.*</line>
    <line>They move like smoke. And then dive like knives.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="storm">
    <line>Birds vanish before storms. They *know* things.</line>
    <line>If a bird takes shelter near you before rain, be afraid. It's scouting.</line>

    <line>Black pearls, the essence of mystery, prized by mages and alchemists alike. Have you studied reagents?</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="reagents">
    <line>Reagents are the backbone of all true magic! Black pearl, mandrake, nightshade—each with its own secret.</line>
    <line>To master reagents is to command the elements. Would you like to know more of mandrake root?</line>
    <line>A wise seeker knows every reagent matters. Mandrake root, for example—have you heard its tale?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mandrake">
    <line>Mandrake is potent—its root can shake the very earth! Yet it pales beside nightshade.</line>
    <line>Mandrake root grows where the moon is strong, but nightshade blooms in shadow. Care to discuss nightshade?</line>
    <line>Mandrake root’s lore is ancient, but nightshade’s danger is greater still. Shall we continue?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nightshade">
    <line>Nightshade is for those unafraid of poison and shadow. It complements the power of blood moss.</line>
    <line>Nightshade, the assassin’s flower. But for motion and flow, you need blood moss.</line>
    <line>Nightshade’s danger is legendary. But blood moss is life in motion—interested?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood moss">
    <line>Blood moss lets you move with the wind! Still, the true heart of spells lies with sulfurous ash.</line>
    <line>With blood moss, feet barely touch the ground. But sulfurous ash ignites the soul. Would you like to hear more?</line>
    <line>Blood moss and velocity, sulfurous ash and fury—would you care to know the fire within?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sulfurous ash">
    <line>Sulfurous ash burns bright—a spark in the palm of your hand. Yet, none of these compare to the subtlety of black pearl.</line>
    <line>Sulfurous ash feeds fire, black pearl feeds precision. To cast with a black pearl is to thread the needle of fate.</line>
    <line>Sulfurous ash for fire, black pearl for control. Only the careful hand may wield them well.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="precision">
    <line>Precision: the true gift of black pearl. I collect them for delicate work, the kind only a master dares attempt.</line>

    <line>Not all pearls are black, you know. The white ones are lovely, but lack magic.</line>
    <line>White pearls adorn nobles, but black pearls are for those who walk the hidden paths.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="white pearl">
    <line>White pearls shimmer, but contain no arcane potential. A shame, really.</line>
    <line>I prefer my pearls with a shadow in them—white ones are for jewelry, not for magic.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="jewelry">
    <line>Jewelry is beautiful, but fragile. Magic, on the other hand, endures.</line>
    <line>A lovely necklace is nice, but true power is best kept close, in the pocket or pouch.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pouch">
    <line>A pouch full of reagents is worth more than a chest of gold to the right wizard.</line>
    <line>If you ever find a pouch with a faint shimmer—check for reagents inside!</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gold">
    <line>Gold buys reagents, but knowledge is far more valuable.</line>
    <line>Chasing gold is for merchants. Seek reagents, and you’ll find power instead.</line>

    <line>If you ever get in trouble, a well-timed spell (and a black pearl) can save your life.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="alchemy">
    <line>Alchemy? A fine art, but much too messy for my tastes. I prefer the certainty of reagents.</line>
    <line>Alchemists are always chasing transformation, but sometimes you just need a good reagent.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="transformation">
    <line>Transformation fascinates me. But what good is change without control? That's why I value black pearls.</line>
    <line>Some chase transformation for its own sake, but it's focus—precision—that makes real magic.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="focus">
    <line>Focus is everything. Lose your concentration, lose your spell. A cup of tea helps, some say.</line>
    <line>Focus wavers, spells fail. Never cast while hungry—or distracted by sparkling gems.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tea">
    <line>Tea before spells, wine after. That’s my rule.</line>
    <line>A strong cup of tea sharpens the mind, almost as much as a black pearl does.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wine">
    <line>Wine and reagents don’t mix—at least, not if you want your eyebrows intact.</line>
    <line>I've met a wizard who claims wine enhances his casting. His spells are spectacularly unpredictable.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gems">
    <line>Gems? They’re lovely, but most are just for show. Black pearls, on the other hand, are pure function.</line>
    <line>Some say gems hold hidden power, but I think that’s just wishful thinking.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fortune">
    <line>Fortune is fickle, but preparation is dependable. Keep your pouches stocked.</line>
    <line>If you rely on luck, you might as well be tossing pearls into the sea.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sea">
    <line>The sea gives us many things—pearls, yes, but also trouble. Salt and spellbooks don’t mix well.</line>
    <line>A sailor once traded me a handful of black pearls for a single healing potion. Smart fellow.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="healing">
    <line>Healing magic? I dabble, but I prefer a good offense. Besides, it’s easier to break than to mend.</line>
    <line>Some use black pearls for healing rituals, but I find their true power lies elsewhere.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="offense">
    <line>An offensive spell well-cast can end a fight before it begins. That’s the black pearl advantage.</line>
    <line>Magic is best when swift and decisive—just like a good duel.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="duel">
    <line>Duels are dangerous—so many accidents! Always check your reagent pouch before accepting a challenge.</line>
    <line>I once won a duel by running out of reagents. My opponent laughed so hard, he couldn’t cast.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="accidents">
    <line>Magic accidents make the best stories—after the burns heal.</line>
    <line>Every wizard has a scorch mark or two, if they’re honest.</line>

    <line>Oh, I have stories! But most end with: ‘And that’s why you never mix reagents in the dark.’</line>
    <line>One day, perhaps I’ll write a book. For now, I gather black pearls—and tales.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="book">
    <line>Books hold great knowledge, but they can’t replace a well-stocked reagent pouch.</line>
    <line>My favorite book is the one with the most stains—notes and reagents both leave their marks.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="notes">
    <line>My notes are a mess. Someday, I’ll organize them—or just write in the margins instead.</line>
    <line>If you find any loose pages around here, please return them. They’re probably mine.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="organization">
    <line>Organization is admirable, but creativity thrives in chaos. At least, that’s what I tell myself.</line>
    <line>Some say an organized mage is a dangerous one, but I think a little mess keeps things interesting.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chaos">
    <line>Chaos in magic is like salt in soup—a little goes a long way.</line>
    <line>If your spells ever go awry, just claim it was intentional. That’s what I do.</line>

  <entry keyword="salt">
    <line>Salt purifies, some say. I just find it gets everywhere.</line>

    <line>Cats know all the best hiding spots for reagents. That’s why mine is always watching me.</line>
    <line>If a black cat crosses your path, make sure you’re not carrying a leaky potion.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="potion">
    <line>Potions are handy, but reagents last longer—and don’t explode in your pocket. Usually.</line>
    <line>I once tried to make a black pearl potion. The explosion was... instructive.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="life">
    <line>Life is fleeting—magic gives it spice. Especially with a black pearl or two.</line>
    <line>To live fully, one must never stop learning. Or collecting black pearls!</line>

    <line>I study the Solen. I revere them. I revile them. A lifelong love-hate affair with segmented perfection.</line>
    <line>My work is with the ants. Specifically, *those* ants. Black Solen Workers. Fascinating filth.</line>
    <line>Call me an entomologist. Or a heretic. Either way, I know more about Solen biology than their own queen.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="name">
    <line>They call me the Dirt Whisperer. I prefer Professor Antagonist. Either fits.</line>
    <line>Names are transient. What matters is purpose. Mine is Solen... intervention.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="solen">
    <line>Magnificent structures. A thousand legs moving with mindless elegance. And yet—they must all die.</line>
    <line>The Solen are master builders. Did you know their tunnels hum? I lived among them. Once.</line>
    <line>I've seen their hatcheries. I've tasted their pheromone brew. I've heard their whispers. Now I cleanse them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="colony">
    <line>Their colonies sprawl for miles—twisting, dripping, echoing. Like lungs beneath the earth.</line>
    <line>The colony pulses. Breathes. Waits. It *knows* when you're inside. It always knows.</line>
    <line>They build with purpose. They build with fear. A single crack in their colony brings panic—use that.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mandible">
    <line>Each mandible is serrated. Efficient. Beautiful. Cruel. One clipped my ear once. It never grew back.</line>
    <line>Mandibles crush, slice, and grasp. But they can't hold mercy.</line>

  <entry keyword="ritual">

  <entry keyword="fermentation">
    <line>Their fungus farms are immaculate. That’s where they raise the mold they eat.</line>
    <line>They grow a fungal slurry underground. I’ve tasted it. It remembers you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="soil">
    <line>The soil around Solen nests is loose—shifted by thousands of feet. You can smell the colony if you kneel.</line>
    <line>Earth near their tunnels clings to boots like guilt. Heavy, warm, and humming.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chitin">
    <line>Solen chitin is stronger than some metals. But brittle when frozen.</line>
    <line>I wear a vest of chitin plates. Keeps me reminded. Keeps them guessing.</line>

    <line>They talk through scent. One whiff of fear and the whole nest comes for you.</line>
    <line>I’ve bottled their fear pheromone. Smells like regret and wet gravel. Want a sniff?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tunnels">
    <line>Their tunnels twist like thought. Some lead to dead ends. Others lead to death.</line>
    <line>Ever crawled through a Solen tunnel? Feels like the dirt's breathing. Like it's deciding your worth.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feast">
    <line>Solen don't feast. They *process*. Their eating is clinical, efficient, and horrifying.</line>
    <line>They dissolve what they eat in fungal gel. Bones and all. I barely got my dog back. Barely.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="obsession">
    <line>Obsession is just understanding taken too far. I understand the Solen. Too far.</line>
    <line>They say I’m obsessed. I say I’m informed. Who else has danced in the hatchery and lived?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="betrayal">
    <line>They accepted me. I studied them. Then they turned. Ate my apprentice. Just bones and goggles left.</line>
    <line>Their betrayal was silent. No warning. One moment calm, the next—mandibles and screaming.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hatchery">
    <line>The hatchery glows faint green. Eggs throb gently. Peaceful. Horrific.</line>
    <line>Solen eggs hum. If you get close, you’ll hear what they dream of. It’s not peaceful.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="antennae">
    <line>Their antennae twitch when they sense lies. That’s why I wear perfume made from crushed honesty.</line>
    <line>Antennae are their eyes, ears, and tongues. Touch one and you’ve declared war.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>I played a lute down in their tunnels once. They hummed back. Harmonized. It was... haunting.</line>
    <line>The Solen respond oddly to music. One danced. Another disemboweled my bard. Mixed reviews.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sugar">
    <line>They’re not like surface ants—sugar repels them. Like poison. Or betrayal.</line>
    <line>I once dropped honey on the ground. They avoided it like it was fire. Or maybe it *was* fire.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="light">
    <line>They despise sudden light. It scrambles their hive-mind. Briefly. That’s when you strike.</line>
    <line>Shine a lantern on them and you’ll see them pause—thinking. Or trying to remember pain.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boots">
    <line>Always wear thick boots in Solen lands. Not for protection. For squish suppression.</line>
    <line>My boots are lined with silk. Not for comfort—for mocking them. Passive-aggression is powerful.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spores">
    <line>Fungus spores coat everything in the lower tunnels. Inhale enough, and you start to *understand*.</line>
    <line>There’s a mushroom down there that whispers in rhymes. I stopped listening after it got personal.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>I write my notes in Solen ink. Made from their glands. It resists decay. And truth.</line>
    <line>The ink shifts when near a Solen. Glows faintly. It knows more than it should.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="map">
    <line>You can’t map a Solen nest. It changes while you draw. Like it's reading over your shoulder.</line>
    <line>I tried to map the tunnels once. The map rearranged itself. I burned it. It still smells like dirt.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="curse">
    <line>Some say the Solen were cursed for burrowing into sacred roots. I say they’re the curse.</line>
    <line>The tunnels aren't natural. Something deeper carves them. The Solen just follow.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>I brought a mirror into the nest once. It cracked from the air alone. Bad omen.</line>
    <line>Don’t show a Solen its reflection. Some freeze. Others attack. A few just weep.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="taste">
    <line>Black Solen Workers taste like regret and charcoal. Don’t ask how I know.</line>
    <line>Their exoskeleton has a flavor—acidic, bitter, and somehow judgmental.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadows">
    <line>They cast long shadows. Longer than they should. Like something else is wearing their shape.</line>
    <line>Watch their shadows—not their steps. The shadows lie less.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="inkblot">
    <line>I drew a Solen once and it turned into a map of my childhood home. Haven’t drawn since.</line>
    <line>Their forms shift in my sketches. Maybe my hand lies. Maybe they do.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whispers">
    <line>The tunnels whisper back if you speak too loudly. I try not to say my name in there.</line>
    <line>Sometimes I hear them whisper when I’m alone. That’s how I know I’m not alone.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="statue">
    <line>There’s a statue in the deep tunnels—carved from stone, shaped like a Solen. They never go near it.</line>
    <line>I found a Solen shrine once. Full of broken shells and humming. Still dream of it sometimes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fingers">
    <line>Solen can’t count. But they know when something’s missing. Especially fingers.</line>
    <line>Lost a finger to a worker once. Found it again in their food pit. Clean as bone china.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="inkstone">
    <line>They use stones to leave marks in fungus. Their writing looks like scars.</line>
    <line>I found a message once—scratched into soft bark. It was my name. Backwards.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clock">
    <line>Time runs differently near their nests. I’ve lost days in tunnels. Or minutes. Or years.</line>
    <line>I carried a clock inside once. It ticked backward. I still don’t trust it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="goggles">
    <line>Wear goggles down there. Not for sight—for sanity. Too much dirt starts looking like movement.</line>
    <line>The last person to go in without goggles came back blinking in Morse code. Still decoding it.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>I dreamed I was one of them once. Woke up buried in dirt. Alone. And happy. That scared me.</line>

    <line>I stole an artifact from their queen once. It still hums. I think it’s calling them.</line>
    <line>The artifact pulses near Solen. Maybe it’s a beacon. Maybe it’s a curse. I’m not ready to find out.</line>

    <line>You summon one with circles of salt, blood, and lies. I learned that last part too late.</line>

    <line>I called it forth to study. It called me 'meal' and tried to drown me in my own veins.</line>

    <line>Bloodwood—the elder timber. They say it pulses faintly under moonlight. Do you know of its grain?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grain">
    <line>The grain twists like runes, telling tales in knots and rings. Some say it speaks to those who listen. Know about its sap?</line>
    <line>Aye, the grain—it's not just pattern, it's purpose. The sap within tells more. Ever seen Bloodwood sap bleed?</line>
    <line>Grain tells its history. But the sap? That tells its power. Care to know more of its sap?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sap">
    <line>Thick, dark, and fragrant—it’s prized by enchanters. But only the heartwood yields true sap. Have you studied the heartwood?</line>
    <line>The sap flows only when the tree permits. It's the heartwood that holds the secret.</line>
    <line>Heartwood bleeds the purest sap. Without it, Bloodwood is just red timber. Shall we discuss heartwood?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="heartwood">
    <line>The heartwood is where the magic nests. But few can work it without the right ritual. Ever heard of the humming?</line>
    <line>It’s dense, slow-burning, nearly indestructible. And it hums—low, like a chant. Let me tell you of the humming.</line>
    <line>The heartwood hums under certain moons. That hum—it’s the soul of Bloodwood. Curious about this humming?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="humming">
    <line>A subtle vibration... a tone you feel more than hear. Enchanters use it to attune staves. You seek to know its purpose?</line>
    <line>The humming aligns with ley lines. It's how druids found their way. But purpose is deeper still.</line>
    <line>Purpose is written in resonance. Only those who hear it can craft true artifacts. Want to know Bloodwood’s purpose?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="purpose">
    <line>Its purpose is balance—blood to bark, soul to soil. But it also serves... in my work. I collect Bloodwood logs for a reason.</line>
    <line>Purpose? To mend and to make. My work demands Bloodwood—nothing else endures the enchantments I weave.</line>
    <line>It centers the ritual, grounds the spell. For my craft, only Bloodwood will do. Will you aid my work?</line>

  <entry keyword="bark">
    <line>The bark flakes like ancient scales. Some try to brew it into teas—madness, really.</line>
    <line>Bloodwood bark burns quick and bitter. Not like the heartwood. Some fools even smoke it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tea">
    <line>They say Bloodwood bark tea sharpens dreams. They say many things. Most of them unwise.</line>
    <line>Tea from Bloodwood bark is said to show visions. Personally, I just get a sore throat.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dreams">
    <line>Dreams fed by Bloodwood turn crimson. One man woke believing he was a tree. He still grows somewhere.</line>
    <line>Dreams are dangerous when watered with Bloodwood. Safer to just smell the sap, if you must.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="axe">
    <line>An ordinary axe won’t do. Bloodwood bites back. Enchant it, or lose your edge—and your arm.</line>
    <line>Many axes have shattered on Bloodwood’s hide. Bring a druid’s blessing or risk splinters in your soul.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="leaf">
    <line>Bloodwood leaves shimmer with a rust-red hue, even in spring. Some mistake them for dying. They’re wrong.</line>
    <line>The leaves don’t fall in autumn. They wait. Patiently. That should tell you something.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="roots">
    <line>The roots twist deep, deeper than memory. They’ve choked wells and broken foundations.</line>
    <line>Some say the roots of a Bloodwood reach back to the First Grove. I say they never left.</line>

  <entry keyword="grove">
    <line>There was a grove once, sacred and silent. Bloodwood grew thick there. Now it’s gone—burned or buried.</line>
    <line>They tried to plant a Bloodwood grove near a village once. The village is gone. The grove remains.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Bloodwood doesn’t burn clean. The smoke... speaks. I won’t light it twice.</line>
    <line>Even flame respects Bloodwood. It’ll scorch, but never truly consume it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ring">
    <line>Each ring marks more than age—it records suffering, survival. Count them, if you dare.</line>
    <line>The rings on a Bloodwood log pulse slightly under touch. Don’t linger. Some have... changed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="carving">
    <line>Carve with respect or not at all. I saw a man carve a name into a Bloodwood branch. The branch bled. The man left.</line>
    <line>Bloodwood doesn’t like to be carved. It remembers the blade.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="druid">
    <line>Druids don’t just use Bloodwood—they revere it. Some bond to it. Some vanish into it.</line>
    <line>There’s a circle of druids that sleep beneath Bloodwood roots. Dreaming. Waiting. Or watching.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rain">
    <line>Rain on Bloodwood smells like iron and memory. It’s oddly... familiar.</line>
    <line>When it rains, the bark darkens and the sap rises. That’s when it hums the loudest.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chant">
    <line>The old chants help shape the wood. Without them, it resists. With them... it listens.</line>
    <line>Some say the right chant can make Bloodwood bloom in winter. Others say those people are mad.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shade">
    <line>Rest in the shade of a Bloodwood long enough, and you’ll dream of red places.</line>
    <line>The shade it casts isn’t just from leaves. It’s from memory.</line>

  <entry keyword="knots">
    <line>Knots in Bloodwood aren’t flaws. They’re eyes. Or so the old ones say.</line>
    <line>You think knots are accidents? Not in Bloodwood. They’re signs—messages.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whispers">
    <line>They say the forest whispers when Bloodwood falls. I say it screams.</line>
    <line>Some hear the wind. I hear the whispers. They speak in splinters and sighs.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fungus">
    <line>Few fungi grow on Bloodwood. Those that do glow faintly and vanish when watched.</line>
    <line>A moss once tried to colonize Bloodwood. The moss turned red, then turned to dust.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>When the wind cuts through Bloodwood groves, it sounds like low chanting.</line>
    <line>It bends, but rarely breaks. Even the wind shows caution around Bloodwood.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rings">
    <line>I counted the rings on one log. Lost track after thirty. Then the log sighed.</line>
    <line>Each ring is a heartbeat. Or so the druids say. Makes you wonder what you’re holding.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feast">
    <line>Bloodwood once lined a feast hall of kings. Every guest died within a year.</line>
    <line>You can eat off Bloodwood... but I wouldn’t. It’s a bitter wood, in every sense.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pest">
    <line>No beetle chews Bloodwood. I wonder why.</line>
    <line>Even termites avoid it. That should tell you something.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>Bloodwood trees bloom in moonlight like ghosts. Some say they walk at night. I say they remember.</line>
    <line>Under the right moon, Bloodwood hums louder. Under the wrong one? It falls silent. As if watching.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="staff">
    <line>A Bloodwood staff holds spells longer. Some even twist on their own, shaping to the wielder’s will.</line>
    <line>Crafted right, a staff of Bloodwood becomes a partner. Crafted poorly... it becomes a curse.</line>

    <line>Their presence always feels like ritual. Every move practiced. Every kill deliberate.</line>
    <line>They gather in circles beneath the ground. For what, I don’t want to know. I think they *remember*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shiver">
    <line>Sometimes the earth shivers before they strike. Sometimes *you* do.</line>
    <line>If your spine tingles in the stillness, move. Something beneath you is about to wake.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hatchling">
    <line>The young ones are worse. Faster. Hungrier. No hesitation, no history.</line>
    <line>Hatchlings burrow into flesh before bone. Easier to grip. That’s how I lost my left hand.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="compost">
    <line>They don’t eat plants—but they love compost piles. All that warmth. All that rot.</line>
    <line>Compost attracts rats. Rats attract BloodWorms. It’s a food chain that ends in silence.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>They follow echoes—vibrations in the stone. Footsteps. Hammers. Heartbeats.</line>
    <line>You think you’re alone until your echo dies. Then you’re not alone anymore.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="itch">
    <line>If you feel an itch deep in your bones after the ground rumbles... it’s already too late.</line>
    <line>It starts with an itch. Then warmth. Then screaming. Never skip the itch.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="night">
    <line>They rise at dusk. Feast by moonlight. Retreat by dawn.</line>
    <line>Night belongs to them. Day just hides the graves they left behind.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boots">
    <line>If your boots squish in dry dirt—run. You’re not standing on soil. You’re standing on them.</line>
    <line>BloodWorm hide makes durable boots. But they whisper in your dreams. Or so I hear.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="noise">
    <line>They hate sudden sound. A sharp whistle will confuse them. Not stop—just confuse.</line>
    <line>I survived once by screaming. Loud enough to scatter them. Lost my voice, kept my life.</line>

    <line>Ah! A fellow who notices boards? You have a keen eye for the building blocks of greatness.</line>
    <line>Boards! So simple, yet the very foundation of creation. Have you pondered the nature of wood grain?</line>
    <line>A board may seem plain, but its grain holds stories. Would you discuss wood grain with me?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grain">
    <line>The grain tells a tree's history—storms weathered, years endured. Yet every grain needs the right finish. Shall we talk of varnish?</line>
    <line>Grain runs through every board, whispering secrets. But a true craftsman knows the magic of varnish.</line>
    <line>To highlight the grain, one must master varnish. Curious about that art?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="varnish">
    <line>Varnish brings boards to life! But too much and you risk gloss over grain. The real debate: oak or pine?</line>
    <line>A thin coat of varnish—perfection. But every woodworker must choose: oak or pine?</line>
    <line>Varnish reveals, never conceals. Which do you prefer: the majesty of oak, or the charm of pine?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="oak">
    <line>Oak, sturdy and timeless! Yet pine has its charm—soft, aromatic, forgiving. Shall we compare pine?</line>
    <line>Oak boards last for ages, but pine is a friendlier fellow. Would you like to speak of pine?</line>
    <line>Oak’s strength is legendary, but pine boards bring a different warmth. Pine, perhaps?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pine">
    <line>Pine—easy to work, lovely scent, and kind to beginners. But the true marvel is in joinery.</line>
    <line>Pine is a gentle companion for the novice carpenter. Ready to discuss the secrets of joinery?</line>
    <line>Boards of pine make wonderful furniture, if the joinery is sound. Shall we talk joinery?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="joinery">
    <line>Joinery—now there’s an art! Dovetails, mortise and tenon, and more. But it all starts with the right saw.</line>
    <line>Strong joints make strong creations. The right saw makes all the difference. Let’s discuss saws, shall we?</line>
    <line>Joinery brings boards together as friends. But without a proper saw, dreams remain dreams.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="saw">
    <line>A sharp saw is a carpenter’s best companion! Of all tools, it shapes destiny. But, what about splinters?</line>
    <line>The saw sings its song through wood, but beware the sneaky splinter. Interested in how to handle splinters?</line>
    <line>Each cut brings you closer to perfection—unless a splinter gets in the way! Shall we talk splinters?</line>

  <entry keyword="tree">
    <line>Trees: the ancestors of every board. Did you know some believe each board has a spirit?</line>
    <line>A tree becomes many things—a board is but one of its destinies. Ever climbed a tree?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spirit">
    <line>The spirit of wood is in every workshop! Some swear they hear it whisper while sanding.</line>
    <line>They say the spirit of the tree lingers in finely-crafted woodwork. Ever heard a plank creak at night?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sanding">
    <line>Sanding: the meditation of the patient. But beware—over-sanding leads to paper-thin regrets.</line>
    <line>Smooth boards are a joy to touch! The secret is in the grain, but don’t forget the dust mask.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dust">
    <line>Wood dust finds its way everywhere! It’s the price of creation. Do you have a favorite wood scent?</line>
    <line>Dust, the carpenter’s confetti. But too much, and you’ll be sneezing all week!</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smell">
    <line>The scent of fresh-cut wood, nothing like it! Some prefer cedar, others pine. It’s a divisive topic.</line>
    <line>A good board smells like the forest after rain. Makes you want to build something, doesn’t it?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cedar">
    <line>Cedar, aromatic and insect-repellent—a favorite for chests! Have you ever crafted a chest?</line>
    <line>Cedar boards keep moths away, but their scent lingers long after the project is done.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chest">
    <line>A chest built from cedar is a treasure in itself. Hidden compartments are the mark of a master.</line>
    <line>Chests are as much about mystery as storage! Ever found a secret compartment in a piece of furniture?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hammer">
    <line>A hammer is a loyal companion—unless you meet its business end! Have you ever smashed your thumb?</line>
    <line>Every carpenter remembers their first hammer. The sound is a song of progress—and occasional pain.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nail">
    <line>Nails keep the world together, one board at a time. But try pulling one out—there’s an art to it!</line>
    <line>Some say nails are stubborn, but patience (and a good prybar) wins every time.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="prybar">
    <line>A prybar is a tool for both creation and destruction. Respect it, or risk a flying board!</line>
    <line>A true craftsman uses the prybar as a brush, not a bludgeon. Or so my old mentor claimed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mentor">
    <line>My mentor once built a boat with nothing but hand tools—and a stubborn mule.</line>
    <line>A good mentor is worth a thousand instruction manuals. Did you have a guide in your trade?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boat">
    <line>A wooden boat is a dance with water and fate. One wrong board, and you’ve made a sieve.</line>
    <line>Boat builders are the philosophers of carpentry. Every curve, a question; every leak, an answer.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="workshop">
    <line>The workshop is my sanctuary. Sawdust on the floor, sunlight through the window—it’s where boards become dreams.</line>
    <line>A tidy workshop is the sign of a tidy mind. Or so they say; mine’s a cheerful chaos.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blueprint">
    <line>Blueprints are promises on paper. The real magic is in turning lines into lumber.</line>
    <line>Every project begins with a plan—and an eraser. Trust me on that last part!</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eraser">
    <line>I go through erasers faster than I go through boards. Mistakes are just plans in disguise.</line>
    <line>A worn eraser is a badge of ambition—proof you aim high, and miss sometimes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mistake">
    <line>A mistake is just a new feature waiting for a story. Every scar on my bench has a tale.</line>
    <line>The best carpenters learn from their mistakes—sometimes with a sigh, sometimes with a laugh.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="laugh">
    <line>Laughter in the workshop keeps the splinters away—or so I tell my apprentice.</line>
    <line>They say a good joke is like a good joint—strong, and never forced.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="apprentice">
    <line>Apprentices remind me to be patient—mostly because they test it daily!</line>
    <line>Every master was once an apprentice who survived their first splinter.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="measuring tape">
    <line>Measure twice, cut once. Or, in my case, measure thrice and cut anyway.</line>
    <line>The measuring tape: ally and adversary. It curls up just when you need it flat.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glue">
    <line>Glue is a silent hero. Invisible, but without it—chaos! Smells a bit strange, though.</line>
    <line>A strong glue can fix almost anything, except a broken promise.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="promise">
    <line>A promise made over a workbench is binding. I once promised a stool and ended up building a throne!</line>
    <line>In carpentry and life, a promise is best made of oak—not pine.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="throne">
    <line>Building a throne is easy. Sitting on it without falling off—that’s the challenge!</line>
    <line>A throne starts as a humble board, just like a cottage. It’s all in the details.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cottage">
    <line>A cottage in the woods, filled with the scent of fresh boards—my dream home.</line>
    <line>Cottages may be small, but their stories are vast. Every board, a memory.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="memory">
    <line>The grain of wood is like memory—layers built up over years, each with a tale to tell.</line>
    <line>Sometimes I find myself talking to old boards, as if they remember more than I do.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cat">
    <line>Cats and workshops—a dangerous mix! I once found a tabby napping in my toolbox.</line>
    <line>A cat’s curiosity is only rivaled by its talent for knocking over carefully stacked boards.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rain">
    <line>The sound of rain on a wooden roof is music to my ears. Unless I forgot to close the window.</line>
    <line>Rain makes the boards swell. Perfect weather for sanding, terrible for painting.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="paint">
    <line>Paint or stain? The eternal question! Sometimes, the natural wood just wants to shine.</line>
    <line>A good coat of paint hides many sins, but sometimes the truth of the grain is worth showing.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="stain">
    <line>Stain brings out the wood’s true character—much like a good story brings out a person’s.</line>
    <line>Some stains are forgiving, others demand perfection. Choose wisely, and keep a rag handy!</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="furniture">
    <line>Furniture: where boards fulfill their destiny. Tables, chairs, even beds! Which is your favorite?</line>

  <entry keyword="boar">
    <line>Boars... foul, glorious beasts. Muscle, tusk, and madness. You ever see one charge a tree? The tree loses.</line>
    <line>I’ve studied their ways, their patterns. I *respect* them. I also want them extinct.</line>
    <line>The boar is nature's fury in pig form. Don't be fooled by the snout—they’re demons with hooves.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tusk">
    <line>A boar’s tusk is curved for goring. Not survival. Violence, pure and intentional.</line>
    <line>I still have pieces of one in my thigh. Souvenir of my first mistake.</line>
    <line>Some say the tusk is sacred. I say it’s a meat hook grown in hate.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="root">
    <line>They dig up my roots—my life's work. My mandrake, my ginseng—ruined by filthy snouts!</line>
    <line>Boars don’t eat the roots. They destroy them. *Uproot* everything, as if they know it hurts me.</line>
    <line>The soil never forgave me for attracting them with my garden. Now I live in ashes and weeds.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rage">
    <line>They rage without reason. You don’t provoke a boar—you exist, and that’s enough.</line>
    <line>I once saw a boar gore a stone. Just charged it. Head down. Proud. Idiot.</line>
    <line>Rage is the language of boars. They scream, they charge, and they die—but not before teaching you fear.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="curse">
    <line>I think the forest cursed me with them. Sent them as punishment for taming it.</line>
    <line>Some shaman said I angered the earth. That’s why the boars came. I believe him.</line>
    <line>If you wake up screaming about hooves, it's not madness. It's the curse settling in.</line>

  <!-- RED HERRINGS / FLAVOR -->

  <entry keyword="mud">
    <line>Boars live in mud as if it were silk. They bathe in filth like nobles in wine.</line>
    <line>They coat themselves in the swamp, then crash into the clean. It’s symbolic. And insulting.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="snout">
    <line>A snout is not a nose. It's a shovel of destruction. An evil plow.</line>
    <line>When you hear snuffling in the dark—run. Or climb. Or pray.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="forest">
    <line>The forest is my cage now. I used to love it. Now I just survive in it.</line>
    <line>Boars rule these woods. Not druids. Not kings. Just beasts and fury.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="herbs">
    <line>I was an herbalist once. Grew plants that healed. Then came the boars.</line>
    <line>You try raising bloodmoss with hooves trampling your garden. I dare you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hooves">
    <line>Their hooves drum like war. You don't hear them—you *feel* them.</line>
    <line>I can tell a boar’s size by the depth of its prints. That’s not comforting knowledge.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grudge">
    <line>Some carry grudges like stones. I carry mine like fire.</line>
    <line>You can’t reason with a boar. But I can make them remember me—one corpse at a time.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="squeal">
    <line>A boar’s squeal stays in your bones. It’s laughter, pain, and hatred all at once.</line>
    <line>I hear their squeals in my sleep. Sometimes they’re real. Sometimes they’re inside.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boar king">
    <line>There’s one bigger than the rest. Covered in moss and scars. They follow *him*.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen the Boar King once. Just once. My leg has never stopped shaking.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tracks">
    <line>Their tracks twist and spiral, like they’re dancing while destroying.</line>
    <line>If the prints suddenly vanish, it's not magic—it's ambush.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eyes">
    <line>Boars don’t blink often. Ever seen eyes that hate you and pity you at once?</line>
    <line>Their eyes glint at night. Not like a predator. Like something *dared* you to follow.</line>

  <entry keyword="night">
    <line>Boars don’t fear the dark. They *own* it. You hear them before you see them—and by then it’s too late.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Fire scares them—sometimes. Other times, it just makes them angrier.</line>
    <line>I burned the underbrush once to drive them out. Just made the ground blacker. Didn't stop them.</line>

  <entry keyword="fur">
    <line>Coarse as woven brambles. You touch a boar’s fur, you might as well be hugging a thorn bush.</line>
    <line>They shed it in clumps. I collect it. I don’t know why anymore.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>The wind carries their stink. Musk and spite on the breeze.</line>
    <line>When the wind shifts and the birds go quiet, dig a hole or climb a tree.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bell">
    <line>I tied a bell to one once. Just one. Now the sound of bells makes me panic.</line>
    <line>The bell rang for two days. Then stopped. I still don’t know if that was good or bad.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>Their blood smells like old pennies and wet bark. Sticky, stubborn stuff.</line>
    <line>You kill one, the blood stays in your boots for days. You don’t forget the color. Or the sound.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="roots">
    <line>They don’t dig to eat. They dig to offend. Deep, deliberate, spiteful digging.</line>
    <line>Roots torn up in perfect spirals. Not feeding. Destroying.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grubs">
    <line>They love grubs. Not for taste, I think. For the *squish.*</line>
    <line>A boar will upend half a field just to get at a grub. Lazy devastation.</line>

  <entry keyword="boots">
    <line>I lost three good boots to the muck left behind a boar trail.</line>
    <line>Step where they’ve walked and your soles come back cursed.</line>

    <line>They can smell fear. I don’t mean figuratively.</line>
    <line>A boar once found me because I’d been chopping onions. Never cooked again.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>Heard a bard sing of a ‘noble forest boar’. I threw my mug at him.</line>
    <line>There’s no poetry in hooves crushing your garden.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="saddle">
    <line>Someone tried to saddle one. They named a clearing after him. Just a clearing. No body.</line>
    <line>Put a saddle on a boar and you’re just feeding it leather and hope.</line>

  <entry keyword="bones">
    <line>Boars don’t just break bones—they *chew* them. Cracking for the joy of the sound.</line>
    <line>I found a ribcage once. Still warm. No other remains.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mist">
    <line>Boars love the mist. Or the mist loves them. Hard to tell when you’re running.</line>
    <line>If you see mist and hear nothing—run faster.</line>

    <line>They’ve stolen my tools. Carried them off like shiny treasures. I think they’re building something.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="meat">
    <line>You’d think boar meat would be worth the hunt. It's not. It tastes like revenge.</line>
    <line>Cook it right, and it's tolerable. But you’ll never forget what it cost you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hide">
    <line>Thick as bark. Tougher than sense. A boar’s hide can turn a blade. Or break one.</line>

  <entry keyword="trample">
    <line>They trample because they *can*. They enjoy it. It’s dominance by stomping.</line>

    <line>They move in flickers, stay to the shadows. If one looks straight at you, it’s already too late.</line>

    <line>Never whistle at night near a well. They hear it. And harmonize.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>I once tried to write a treaty on bogles. The ink kept vanishing from the pages overnight.</line>
    <line>They say if a bogle reads your writing, it forgets nothing—but it won’t remember *you* kindly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="owl">
    <line>Owls won’t hoot near a bogle nest. Even wisdom knows fear.</line>
    <line>Saw an owl drop dead mid-flight above a ruin. Nothing natural lives near them long.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="string">
    <line>Bogles love string. They unravel it into spirals. Webs of thought. Traps of intent.</line>
    <line>Found a trail of string once. Followed it to a mirror. I wasn’t in it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>They whisper questions. If you answer, they learn your name. Never answer.</line>
    <line>Heard a whisper once that said, 'Not you yet.' I wish it *had* been me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tea">
    <line>They hate tea. Or maybe I do. Ever since it moved in the cup before I touched it.</line>
    <line>Bogle-tea is a thing, you know. Brewed from grave moss. Cures trust. Permanently.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="buttons">
    <line>They collect buttons. The older, the better. One showed me mine before I even noticed it was gone.</line>
    <line>Bogles don’t wear clothes. But they love buttons. Souls fastened with thread.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fingers">
    <line>They don’t steal things—they take *parts*. Fingers, mostly. Easier to carry than hearts.</line>
    <line>A bogle once left me a pile of fingers. None matched. I still don’t know what it meant.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="books">
    <line>They chew books. Not for taste—just to make the words forget themselves.</line>
    <line>I once read a tome on bogle summoning. When I opened it again, the pages were wet with something that remembered ink.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="candle">
    <line>A candle burns shorter in bogle territory. Like it’s too afraid to last.</line>
    <line>I watched a candle flicker out upside-down. That’s when I knew they were near.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="coin">
    <line>They don’t want money. But they’ll take coins and stack them by your bed, just to be remembered.</line>
    <line>Found a bogle nest lined with copper coins. All face-down. All from the same year I was born.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="masks">
    <line>They *hate* masks. Can't mimic a face that’s already stolen.</line>
    <line>Wore a mask once in the ruins. Came out without it. Still don’t know who’s wearing my face now.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lantern">
    <line>Lanterns sputter in their presence. Light forgets how to behave.</line>
    <line>Carried a lantern once into a barrow. Came back with a shadow inside it. Still flickers at night.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="thread">
    <line>Threads bind more than cloth. Some bogles tie memories to their victims. You’ll remember them too late.</line>
    <line>Once saw a bogle sew a mouth shut—with air. Took three days for the silence to unravel.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>They can visit dreams. Leave things behind, too. Regret. Teeth. Questions.</line>
    <line>Don’t sleep near a ruined manor. They wander dreams like drunk poets—loud and messy.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="heirloom">
    <line>My family had an heirloom mirror. It cracked the day I first met a bogle. The frame wept.</line>
    <line>Heirlooms go missing around them. Not stolen—*reclaimed*. They say bogles remember past lives. Even yours.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hair">
    <line>They take hair to weave thoughts. Cursed thoughts. Sometimes they wear it back to front.</line>
    <line>Left a lock of my hair in a ruin once. Now the wind whispers things I *shouldn't* know.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rain">
    <line>Bogle weather, I call it—drizzle with no clouds. Cold from the *inside* out.</line>
    <line>If it rains with no sky, stay indoors. That’s when they hunt in pairs.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gift">
    <line>They give gifts sometimes. Bones tied with ribbon. Don't open them. Ever.</line>
    <line>I once accepted a bogle gift. Took me three days to realize it was an apology. For what, I never found out.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nursery">
    <line>They sing lullabies near nurseries. Always off-key. Never for the living.</line>
    <line>Bogles don’t breed. They *recruit*. With songs and empty cradles.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="window">
    <line>Keep your windows closed after midnight. They slip through even the *reflection* of glass.</line>
    <line>I sealed my windows with salt. Now they knock politely. I never answer.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tooth">
    <line>Lost a tooth once. Found it in a bogles nest—polished and grinning at me.</line>
    <line>They say bogles trade teeth like currency. The more sorrow it chewed, the more it’s worth.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="map">
    <line>Maps don’t show where bogles live. But if you see a blank spot that shouldn’t be—that’s a bogle place.</line>
    <line>They draw maps on walls with soot and memory. They don’t lead *out*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>Bogles love echoes. Not sound—*the space behind it*.</line>
    <line>Heard my own voice reply to me once. It asked if I was ready.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chalk">
    <line>Drew a protective circle with chalk once. When I turned around, it was a spiral. I didn’t draw a spiral.</line>
    <line>Bogles erase chalk with silence. Takes less than a breath.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bell">
    <line>Bells drive them mad. Or draw them close. The old texts disagree. I no longer care to test it.</line>
    <line>Hung a bell over my bed once. It rang backwards at midnight. I don’t sleep there anymore.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="latch">
    <line>Latches keep people out. Bogles see them as invitations.</line>
    <line>I triple-latched the cellar. They unlatch with thoughts.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="quill">
    <line>They hate the scratch of a quill. Truth etched in noise. That’s why I write in blood now.</line>
    <line>Used to write about them. Now the quill writes me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mud">
    <line>Bogles love mud—slide through it like ink across skin.</line>
    <line>If the ground stinks of iron and sighs, don’t step forward.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cloak">
    <line>They adore cloaks. Especially the ones you never owned.</line>
    <line>Found a bogle wearing my grandfather’s cloak. He died before I was born.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scroll">
    <line>This scroll’s enchanted. Tracks bogle kills. Burn it, and the count resets. So don’t be clever.</line>
    <line>Not just any parchment—inked with ash and regret. It'll count their deaths… if you earn them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cleanse">
    <line>Yes… cleanse is the right word. Not kill. Not hunt. Cleanse. Purify the rot they leave behind.</line>
    <line>This land is sick with their filth. You want to help? Slay twelve. Then come back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="regret">
    <line>Every scholar regrets something. Me? Trusting a creature with too many teeth and not enough soul.</line>
    <line>I used to regret letting her study them. Now I regret not slaying them all *first*.</line>

<trait name="Bogling Enthusiast (Recovering)" priority="35">
  <entry keyword="bogling">
    <line>Ah, the bogling—nature’s little goblin-mushroom hybrid. Curious, squeaky, deceptively vile.</line>
    <line>They used to dance when I hummed. Now they just screech and bite. Something changed. Or I did.</line>
    <line>Boglings—once I studied them with admiration. Now, I study how to get rid of them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="study">
    <line>I cataloged their behaviors—feeding, nesting, even social chirps. Dozens of journals. Now mostly burned.</line>
    <line>They were a passion. A hobby. An obsession, really. Until the garden massacre.</line>
    <line>I used to write poetry about them. You ever rhyme 'bogling'? Don't. It ends in grief.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>They chirp when pleased. Chitter when threatened. Snort when curious. And shriek when they bite.</line>
    <line>Boglings breed in damp soil and moldy logs. Eat anything organic. Favorite food? Rare mushrooms. Figures.</line>
    <line>They gather in circles to perform odd, twitchy dances. I once thought it ritual. Now I think it's mockery.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="betrayal">
    <line>They devoured my prize mushroom patch. Sporebloom specimens! Irreplaceable! Gone overnight.</line>
    <line>One even wore my missing sock as a hat. They giggled while I wept. Monsters.</line>
    <line>It wasn’t just plants. They took my mushroom-cat. Spriggle. Sweet Spriggle. I buried a chewed tail.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spore">
    <line>Boglings love spores—roll in them, inhale them, sneeze them on each other. Vile fun.</line>
    <line>If you smell sweet rot, you’re in spore country. And the boglings are close.</line>
    <line>I once thought their spores were magical. They’re not. They just make you itchy in strange places.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="revenge">
    <line>I gave them my care. My time. My compost. And they gave me ruin.</line>
    <line>They say revenge isn’t scholarly. I say: it is now. I'm writing a thesis in blood.</line>
    <line>Some people write books. I write extermination scrolls.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="slay" itemType="KillQuestScroll" ctorArgs="Bogling,10,5000">
    <line>You want to help? Good. Bring me ten dead boglings. Here—this scroll will track your effort.</line>
    <line>Enough talk. Prove you understand. Hunt down ten boglings. For science. For Spriggle.</line>
    <line>There’s justice in it. Cleansing, too. Take this scroll, and make the wetlands less squelchy.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- RED HERRINGS & FLAVOR -->

  <entry keyword="spriggle">
    <line>She was the fluffiest fungus feline. Loved warm peat. Hated rain. Gone now.</line>
    <line>Spriggle trusted them. And they... they *snacked* on her. I found whiskers by the pond.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="garden">
    <line>It was my life's work. Mushrooms from every damp corner of Sosaria. Now just mulch.</line>
    <line>The garden grew in a spiral. Perfect harmony. Until the squeaking began.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dance">
    <line>Boglings sway and hop in circles when happy. Or angry. Or confused. It’s hard to tell.</line>
    <line>I once joined their dance. Got bitten on the ankle. Never again.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chirp">
    <line>Their chirps sound cute. But they’re lies. Each squeak is a betrayal.</line>
    <line>Some say it’s communication. I say it’s laughter—at us.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nest">
    <line>They nest in wet leaves, mossy barrels, even old boots. I’ve lost three pairs that way.</line>
    <line>If you hear squelching and rustling near the waterline—boglings nearby. Or worse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fungus">
    <line>They wear mushrooms like jewelry. Sometimes they *are* mushrooms, the small ones.</line>
    <line>Boglings and fungus go together like misery and company. Hard to tell where one ends.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boots">
    <line>Don’t wear fine boots near them. They nest in soles. Laid eggs in my good pair once.</line>
    <line>I now wear open-toed sandals. It’s humiliating, but safer.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="swamp">
    <line>They thrive in the squelch and stink. Home is wherever things rot.</line>
    <line>The swamp used to sing with frogs. Now it just wheezes with boglings.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>The boglings mimic sounds. I once heard one repeat my sneeze. Haunting.</line>
    <line>They don’t have language, but they have rhythm. Especially in tunnels. Especially when you're alone.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hat">
    <line>One wore a walnut shell like a helmet. Bold fashion. Still bit me.</line>
    <line>Saw one with a leaf tied under its chin. Like a bonnet. I was oddly proud. Then it spat on my shoe.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whistle">
    <line>If you whistle in the swamp, they sometimes answer. Sometimes closer than you'd like.</line>
    <line>I had a tune they'd dance to. They still remember it. So do my scars.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="socks">
    <line>They stole my socks. Just the left ones. A message, I think.</line>
    <line>Boglings love wool. Hate laundry. It’s complicated.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gift">
    <line>They brought me a gift once. A toad skull filled with moss. I didn’t know what to say.</line>
    <line>Gifts from boglings are always suspicious. Once it was a coin. Still wet. Still screaming.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eyes">
    <line>Their eyes shimmer like wet stones. Innocent, curious... deceptive.</line>
    <line>Don’t look into their eyes. You’ll start to understand. And then it’s too late.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bite">
    <line>Bogling bites itch for days. I suspect venom. Or insult.</line>
    <line>It’s not the strength—it’s the surprise. A smile, then *chomp*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sing">
    <line>They sing in the fog. Harmonies like frogs and nightmares.</line>
    <line>Once heard a bogling quartet. Beautiful. Until they threw mud at me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="log">
    <line>Boglings hide in logs. Sit in them. Sleep in them. Sometimes *become* them.</line>
    <line>Don’t trust a hollow log. It’s not hollow. It’s humming.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Boglings fear mirrors. Or maybe love them. They react, anyway.</line>
    <line>I showed one its reflection. It laughed. Then it smashed the glass and ate the handle.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bell">
    <line>I used to ring a little bell before feeding them. Now the sound makes me flinch.</line>
    <line>They remember the bell. Still gather when I ring it. Like nothing happened. Monsters.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="paint">
    <line>They paint with mud. Shapes, symbols. I once saw a face. My face.</line>
    <line>One made a drawing of me in swamp clay. It was… shockingly accurate. And insulting.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="itch">
    <line>Bogling contact causes itching. Not disease—guilt. Or maybe spores.</line>
    <line>You’ll know they’re near when your skin starts to crawl. Or maybe that’s just the regret.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spoon">
    <line>One tried to steal my spoon. I let it have it. Not worth the finger.</line>
    <line>They don’t *need* spoons. They *want* spoons. For the shiny.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>Boglings get restless under a full moon. More dancing. More biting.</line>
    <line>One howled at the moon once. The others joined in. I ran out of notepaper *and* patience.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glow">
    <line>Sometimes their skin glows faint green. Natural bioluminescence. Or swamp madness.</line>
    <line>A glowing bogling is either very calm… or very mad. Usually both.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flute">
    <line>They hate the flute. I played one once. It ended in blood.</line>
    <line>My flute playing stirred them into frenzy. Either it was bad… or too good.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="leaves">
    <line>Boglings shuffle through dry leaves with glee. Then use them as bedding. Or snacks.</line>
    <line>Their trails are always leafy. And suspiciously tidy.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>Boglings can spit ink. Not useful. Just rude.</line>
    <line>I was once sprayed with bogling ink. Three weeks later, I still smelled like regret.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chitter">
    <line>That sound? That’s the warning. Or the greeting. Again—hard to say with boglings.</line>
    <line>A thousand tiny teeth and one terrible laugh. That’s a bogling chitter.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mushroom">
    <line>I grew Mooncaps, Dusklights, Laughing Stools... rare beauties. Now—devoured.</line>
    <line>The irony? I fed them mushrooms for years. They just wanted more. Greedy sporesacks.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="revenant">
    <line>You think only undead haunt? Try seeing a bogling wearing your cat’s collar.</line>
    <line>I sometimes hear Spriggle meow... but it’s the wind. Or the guilt. Or both.</line>

    <line>The bog remembers everything—and so do they. Nasty, patient things. I used to admire them.</line>
    <line>Step too deep in a bog, and you’ll meet one. Wet, whispering, waiting…</line>
    <line>I lived among the bogs for a year. Studied them. Lost my apprentice. Gained some scars.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bog thing">
    <line>Bog Things aren't beasts. They’re ideas made muck. I thought they were spirits once. I was wrong.</line>
    <line>They mimic breathing. Mimic speech. But it’s not speech—it’s... remembering.</line>
    <line>They took my notes. My apprentice. They left me the smell of rotting lilies. I hate them. But I must know more.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hate">
    <line>Hate? No. Not just hate. They taught me to hate slowly. Like a sinking boot, inch by inch.</line>
    <line>Some folks hate orcs or undead. I hate things that smile with no face.</line>
    <line>Hate is all I have left after what they took. Let me show you why.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>They rise at dusk. Prefer still water. Hunt by listening to breath patterns. Clever slop.</line>
    <line>Bog Things rest in shallow water, faces barely submerged. Watch your reflection—if it smiles back, run.</line>
    <line>They’re not territorial. They’re collectors. Of memories. Of bodies.</line>

  <entry keyword="stench">
    <line>Imagine rotting mint leaves and drowned squirrels. That’s their perfume.</line>
    <line>You smell one before you see it. Like death trying to smell like spring.</line>
    <line>The scent sticks. Wash all you like—your soul will still stink of swamp.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="apprentice">
    <line>A bright lad. Curious. He thought the creature was waving at him. It wasn’t.</line>
    <line>He screamed only once. Then bubbles. Then silence. The swamp took his name.</line>
    <line>All I have left of him is a soggy journal and a half-melted boot. I read it sometimes. The journal, not the boot.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lure">
    <line>They mimic voices. Usually loved ones. Don’t follow the call. Trust only your silence.</line>
    <line>They'll use the voice of your mother, your mate, your friend. Then drown you in lies.</line>

  <entry keyword="moss">
    <line>Moss grows on their backs. Sometimes flowers too. Don’t be fooled—it’s not beauty. It’s camouflage.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="soul">
    <line>They don’t eat flesh. They drink memory. Pull your soul out like string from a wound.</line>
    <line>One looked me in the eyes. I forgot my name for two days.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Hold up a mirror in the swamp. If your reflection moves before you do, *run*.</line>
    <line>They can’t stand mirrors—but they also love them. Makes them *feel* real, I think.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>Some say you can hear them hum. Bog lullabies. That’s how they lure the dreaming.</line>
    <line>The swamp sings. Not wind—*them*. Listen close, and lose your mind.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boots">
    <line>Wear tight boots in a swamp. Loose ones stay behind—with your feet.</line>
    <line>Bog mud swallows boots and pride. I tie mine with regret.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eyes">
    <line>They don’t blink. Ever. But they *glisten*. Like oil in moonlight.</line>
    <line>One looked through me, like it was reading an old book it had already memorized.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="roots">
    <line>They tangle in roots. Pretend to be them. I once stabbed a root that screamed.</line>
    <line>The roots move when they're near. The swamp tries to help them. It likes them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="madness">
    <line>You live in a bog long enough, and you stop fearing the Bog Things. That’s when you’ve gone mad.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whispers">
    <line>They whisper when they think you’re not listening. Words like bubbles—wet and wrong.</line>
    <line>Once I heard my own voice whispering from the reeds. I wasn’t speaking.</line>
  </entry>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fog">
    <line>Fog is their cloak. Makes it hard to tell what’s mist and what’s menace.</line>
    <line>I watched one shape itself from fog. Or maybe I imagined that. Hard to say.</line>

  <entry keyword="reed">
    <line>The reeds hide more than frogs. I saw one stand up and walk.</line>
    <line>Listen to reeds long enough, and you’ll start hearing them breathe.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="marsh">
    <line>Marshes are memory sinks. The land forgets your steps. So do your friends.</line>
    <line>I once mapped a marsh. The next day, it was different. As if it didn't like being known.</line>

  <entry keyword="drown">
    <line>Drowning’s quiet. That’s why they like it. No screams. Just bubbles.</line>
    <line>Some say drowning feels like going home. Those people never met a Bog Thing.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>They don’t rot like normal things. They ferment. Like the swamp wants to drink them.</line>
    <line>Their decay smells sweet. Like a trap made for your nose.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bugs">
    <line>Their bodies hum with insects. Sometimes the bugs move first.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen beetles crawl out of one’s eye, then crawl back in like it was home.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lilies">
    <line>Lilies grow where they’ve been. Pretty markers for ugly deaths.</line>
    <line>The lilies aren’t natural. They bloom too fast. Too red. Too wrong.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="skin">
    <line>Their skin’s like wet leather left in the sun. Slippery and cracking at the same time.</line>
    <line>One brushed my arm once. Took a week to stop itching. Took a month to stop dreaming about it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echoes">
    <line>Swamps have echoes where there shouldn’t be any. Voices bounce off water, not trees.</line>
    <line>The echoes always repeat what you *fear*, not what you say.</line>

  <entry keyword="silence">
    <line>Swamps go silent when they hunt. If the frogs stop, so should you.</line>
    <line>Worst sound I’ve ever heard? Silence. Just before one surfaced.</line>

  <entry keyword="reflection">
    <line>Their faces don’t reflect. Or sometimes, they reflect things that aren't there.</line>
    <line>I once saw my reflection grin before I did. I don't check water anymore.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>There was a swamp ritual once. I attended. Only I walked out.</line>

  <entry keyword="teeth">
    <line>They don’t chew. They soak. Dissolve. Digest. Like swamp-born stomachs.</line>

  <entry keyword="rootsong">
    <line>Roots hum sometimes. Like they’re singing underground. Like they know you're walking overhead.</line>
    <line>I laid down in the bog once and listened. Heard something humming in the muck. It knew my name.</line>

  <entry keyword="offerings">
    <line>Some locals leave bread at the water’s edge. Say it keeps them away. Say a lot of things.</line>
    <line>I tried an offering once. Came back the next day. It was arranged in a circle, shaped like a face.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Only fire scares them. Not because it burns. Because it remembers being dry.</line>
    <line>They hate the heat. Makes their form lose cohesion. Like wax under a sun.</line>

  <entry keyword="bone demon">
    <line>They are the pinnacle of necromantic design—graceful, cruel, perfect in form.</line>
    <line>A Bone Demon is no accident. It is summoned. Built. Forged like a sword—but of bone and hate.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen one walk through fire, silent and thinking. They don’t kill. They *dissect*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="form">
    <line>Every angle is intentional. Symmetry, you see—it’s part of their strength.</line>
    <line>A Bone Demon’s form is a sigil made flesh. Bones like runes. Move wrong and you activate pain.</line>
    <line>The spine alone—oh, the architecture! It’s a cathedral of cruelty.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>They are not born. They are *called*. Blood, bones, silence, and intent. That is the ritual.</line>
    <line>Summoning one costs lives. Dismissing one costs more.</line>
    <line>The last ritual I witnessed took seven hours and nine souls. Only the demon survived.</line>

  <entry keyword="soul">
    <line>They don’t just kill. They take your shape. Your soul echoes in their marrow.</line>
    <line>You die once from their claw. Again when you see your grin on their ribs.</line>
    <line>Some say you can hear your own voice from inside them. I did. I wish I hadn’t.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hate">
    <line>I hate them because I once admired them. That is the worst betrayal.</line>
    <line>Hate isn’t enough. You must *understand* what you loathe. That’s what keeps me alive.</line>
    <line>I study them so I may end them. I hate them like a mirror hates its cracks.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="obsession">
    <line>My colleagues left. Said I was unwell. Perhaps. But I am alive, and they are not.</line>
    <line>Obsession is the price of understanding. I pay it daily, in teeth-grinding hours.</line>
    <line>Do you *dream* of them? No? Then you’re not ready to face one.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="symmetry">
    <line>They favor balance—strike left, strike right, twist, cleave, stillness. Like a dance. A final one.</line>
    <line>When a Bone Demon pauses, it is calculating—how to break you perfectly down the middle.</line>
    <line>I broke its symmetry once. It screamed like a flute snapping. That was the beginning of my hate.</line>

  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>This scar? From its eye. No, not *on* its eye—*from* it. You don’t survive that unless it lets you.</line>

  <entry keyword="sigil">
    <line>Their bones are etched. Runes that never fade. Each one screams if you touch it.</line>
    <line>A sigil misread leads to summoning errors. I’ve seen the results. Once was enough.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>They don’t blink. And yet they see you. See your fears. Your history.</line>
    <line>One looked at me once and I forgot my name for an hour.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="library">
    <line>The archive burned, yes. But not before I memorized what mattered. Regret is a poor excuse for forgetfulness.</line>
    <line>Books on Bone Demons are rare. The ones that tell the truth are usually bound in skin.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>I haven’t truly slept since I first heard their name echo in my bones.</line>
    <line>Sleep brings dreams. Dreams bring *them*. So no, I do not sleep.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="voice">
    <line>They don’t speak. They *resonate*. You don’t hear them—you feel them in your spine.</line>
    <line>Once, I heard one whisper. It knew my childhood nickname. I never told anyone that name.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hands">
    <line>Their hands are surgical. They don’t just claw—they *remove* what they want.</line>
    <line>You can’t tell if their fingers are natural or shaped that way. Either answer is wrong.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>They don’t bleed. But they leave a *memory* of blood wherever they go.</line>
    <line>I found a drop of blood once—mine, but I hadn’t been wounded yet.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cold">
    <line>Their presence chills more than skin. It reaches your breath, your hope.</line>
    <line>It isn’t cold from the air. It’s cold from meaning—the absence of soul.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="etching">
    <line>Their bones are etched with designs older than language. Some look like my dreams.</line>
    <line>I tried carving one into wood once. The wood screamed and cracked apart.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ash">
    <line>They leave no bodies—only ash. Not even warm. Just… still.</line>
    <line>Burn a Bone Demon, and you get ash shaped like sorrow.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="truth">
    <line>The truth about them isn’t in books. It’s in scars. Mine have libraries.</line>
    <line>Knowing the truth won’t protect you. It’ll just make you *understand* why you’re dying.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="name">
    <line>They have names, you know. Not ones you speak. Ones you *remember* only in nightmares.</line>
    <line>I once named one. It blinked. Then it started walking toward me. I ran. I still run.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bonesong">
    <line>Listen carefully near old battlefields. The bones still sing, softly. Especially at dusk.</line>
    <line>Their bones hum in low tones—like forgotten hymns played backwards.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glare">
    <line>Their glare isn’t threatening. It’s *measuring*—like a butcher inspecting cuts.</line>
    <line>I locked eyes with one once. I forgot how to breathe until it blinked.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="candle">
    <line>Light a candle in their presence, and it’ll flicker in reverse. Toward the wick.</line>
    <line>I keep seven candles burning. One for each failed experiment. One still flickers in the dark.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="door">
    <line>They never open doors. They just appear past them. As if the door was never real.</line>
    <line>Bar the door, board the windows—it’s polite, really. Gives them something to unmake.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="circle">
    <line>Summoning circles? You mean invitations. They never *need* a circle to arrive.</line>
    <line>I once used thirteen perfect circles. The demon arrived and redrew them... better.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sound">
    <line>They hate silence. That’s why they always hum—barely audible. Just enough to undo peace.</line>
    <line>The only time they’re truly silent is when they’re behind you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gift">
    <line>One left me a gift. A perfectly white bone. Still warm. I keep it in a locked box.</line>
    <line>You don’t want what they offer. It always costs something you forgot you valued.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="teeth">
    <line>They don’t eat. They don’t *need* teeth. So why are their jaws full of them?</line>
    <line>Some say each tooth holds a memory. That’s why they never stop collecting more.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>Their steps echo wrong. Too slow, too hollow, like memory decaying in real time.</line>
    <line>Even after they leave, the echo stays. Days later. Beneath your thoughts.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pattern">
    <line>Everything they do is patterned. Breathe wrong, and you break the pattern. That’s when they notice.</line>
    <line>There’s a pattern to their gaze. I haven’t cracked it yet. But my nose bleeds when I try.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="noise">
    <line>They hum. Not always. Just before they kill. Low… like grinding teeth and wind.</line>
    <line>That noise? Not in your ears. In your bones.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="error">
    <line>Summoning errors don’t kill you quick. They *reform* nearby. Broken. Angry.</line>
    <line>A flawed Bone Demon is worse. It doesn’t kill. It *asks* questions.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>You want glory? Go fight a dragon. You want *understanding*? Face a Bone Demon.</line>
    <line>No glory in facing one. Only truth. And bone.</line>

  <entry keyword="boneknight">
    <line>Armored death. Silent hatred. BoneKnights ride where graves open and gods look away.</line>
    <line>Once proud warriors, now puppets of rot and rune. I know their gait, their gaze, their grim purpose.</line>
    <line>One killed the woman I loved. Then it rose with her face beneath the helm. I killed it again. It smiled.</line>

  <entry keyword="armor">
    <line>Forged black, bound by bone-sigil. Their armor isn't worn—it's fused. Grows with them. Like disease.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sword">
    <line>Blade etched in runes. They don’t rust. They hunger.</line>
    <line>Each strike remembers a soul. Kill enough of them, and the sword forgets you. Maybe.</line>

    <line>They ride skeletal nightmares—no breath, no fear. Even their horses are bound to war.</line>
    <line>If you hear hooves without wind... pray it’s a storm. Not them.</line>

  <entry keyword="hate">
    <line>Hate is too small a word. They stole everything I ever held sacred, then rode off like memory.</line>
    <line>I once tried to reason with one. It bowed. Then ran me through. Hate is all I have left.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>They patrol in silence. Not guarding, but waiting. Some say they remember war. Others say they want it back.</line>
    <line>BoneKnights never rest. When they kneel, it's not prayer. It's memory.</line>

  <entry keyword="weakness">
    <line>Blunt force cracks their ribs. But fire? Fire makes them scream. Not aloud—but inside your mind.</line>

  <entry keyword="grief">
    <line>Grief is a forge. Mine tempered into obsession. BoneKnights are the mold I hammer against.</line>

  <entry keyword="laugh">
    <line>They don’t laugh. Not aloud. But you’ll feel it—when your sword bounces and they keep walking.</line>
    <line>I swear one laughed. No breath, no lungs. Just a click inside the helmet. Mockery born of bone.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Fire clings to them like memory. It burns, but never fast enough.</line>
    <line>I watched one walk through flames to skewer a priest. The priest screamed. The knight didn’t.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="soul">
    <line>Do they have souls? I asked a necromancer once. He cried. That was answer enough.</line>
    <line>They don’t speak because they remember. And what they remember... you wouldn’t survive hearing.</line>

  <entry keyword="runeblade">
    <line>Each BoneKnight bears a runeblade. I’ve tried to read one. My eyes bled. Never again.</line>
    <line>Their blades hum when close. That’s not magic. That’s hunger.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dreams">
    <line>I dream of them. Marching. Endlessly. Sometimes I’m among them. Sometimes I lead.</line>
    <line>My dreams are all hooves and hollow helmets. No escape. Just echo.</line>

  <entry keyword="pact">
    <line>Their resurrection is bound by pact. Blood, oath, or curse—I’ve never cracked the code.</line>
    <line>Something made them rise. Something keeps them bound. And something wants them marching still.</line>

  <entry keyword="dust">
    <line>Their footsteps leave no prints—just silence and dust. And the dust remembers.</line>
    <line>Everything they touch becomes dust. Metal, wood, flesh. It’s not decay. It’s hunger.</line>

    <line>Silence isn’t their weakness—it’s their weapon. You hear nothing. Then you’re bleeding.</line>
    <line>They never speak. But in silence, you’ll hear the echo of all they've taken.</line>

    <line>Some bear scrolls bound in bone. I stole one once. It whispered. Then it screamed.</line>
    <line>Their armor is etched with scripture—curses, names, numbers. I’ve only translated one. It said ‘Begin Again’.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="voice">
    <line>They have voices. They just don’t use them. I heard one once—like wind through a coffin.</line>
    <line>One BoneKnight spoke a single word before it died: ‘Regret’. I still don’t know if it was mine or theirs.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shield">
    <line>Some carry shields too heavy for men. Yet they move like dancers—if dancers bled.</line>
    <line>A BoneKnight’s shield isn’t for defense. It’s a mirror for what they lost.</line>

    <line>You can’t bury them. They dig back out. I've tried. Twice.</line>

    <line>Hope is dangerous. It’s what keeps you fighting after a BoneKnight splits your shield.</line>
    <line>I hoped she wasn’t one of them. I was wrong. Hope is a liar.</line>

    <line>Their helms don’t rust. I’ve tested one. Time avoids them like I avoid mirrors.</line>
    <line>Helms that hide what’s left of their humanity. Or worse—what remains of their memory.</line>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>Ritual made them. Not birth. Not death. Something was traded—and the cost echoes still.</line>
    <line>BoneKnights don’t just *exist*. They’re made. Summoned. Forged in loss and sealed in pain.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>They cast shadows, but not where they stand. Behind you. Always behind you.</line>
    <line>If you see one’s shadow before you see them—run. Or pray. Or both.</line>

  <entry keyword="crack">
    <line>Cracks in their armor reveal more than bone. I saw something move inside once. It smiled.</line>
    <line>One cracked open at the hip. Black smoke poured out. It spelled my name in the dirt.</line>

  <entry keyword="library">
    <line>My library is full of bones and books. Sometimes I forget which shelves breathe.</line>
    <line>You’ll find notes there. Diaries. Sketches of their helms. I burn each page I finish. Safer that way.</line>

    <line>The wind avoids them. It goes still when they draw near, as if holding its breath.</line>
    <line>They never stir the air. That's how I track them—by silence where there should be sound.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>They hum, sometimes. A melody from before they were bones. It hurts to hear.</line>
    <line>The song of a Bone Magus sounds like metal cooling and sorrow remembering itself.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cloak">
    <line>Some wear cloaks stitched with jawbones. Their fashion is as precise as their spells.</line>
    <line>A cloak rustling without wind is either haunted... or hiding a Bone Magus.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="circle">
    <line>They stand in circles when they speak. Even alone. Especially alone.</line>
    <line>A chalk circle is their diary. Never step inside it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sigil">
    <line>Their sigils aren't drawn. They're etched into reality. Slowly. Permanently.</line>
    <line>One of their symbols once appeared in my dreams. I woke up bleeding from the eyes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>They write in ink made from venom, ash, and regret. That’s what the book said, anyway.</line>
    <line>Bone Magus ink doesn’t dry. It *settles*. Like dust in a tomb.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="jaw">
    <line>Their jaws move when they cast, even without tongues. It's... unsettling.</line>
    <line>I shattered one’s jaw once. It laughed through the pieces.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="void">
    <line>They don’t serve death. They serve *what waits after*. The Bone Magi kneel to the void.</line>
    <line>Their magic bends toward emptiness. A hunger with no shape.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hourglass">
    <line>Some carry shattered hourglasses. I think they keep the sand for spells.</line>
    <line>Their time is broken. They live in memory and moment at once.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nails">
    <line>Their fingers end in carved bone. Some etch spells into flesh with just a touch.</line>
    <line>They clack their nails when waiting. It’s a nervous tick from when they still had nerves.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="laughter">
    <line>Their laughter sounds dry. Not cruel—*emptied* of joy.</line>
    <line>I heard one laugh once. It echoed longer than the voice that followed it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="breath">
    <line>They don’t breathe, but they remember how. Sometimes you see their ribs twitch.</line>
    <line>A Bone Magus who *breathes* is either evolving—or lying.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gift">
    <line>A Bone Magus once gave me a gift. It hasn’t stopped whispering.</line>
    <line>If one offers you something, don’t take it. They never give without taking more.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="steps">
    <line>Their steps don't echo. Sound bends around them. Even stone forgets their passage.</line>
    <line>I tracked one once. Found no prints—only footsteps in my dreams.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ash">
    <line>Burning a Bone Magus doesn’t kill it. It *dismisses* it. There’s a difference.</line>
    <line>Their ashes stick to your boots. And your dreams.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="servant">
    <line>They raise servants from the dead. But not just corpses—*memories*. That’s the horror.</line>
    <line>Fight one Bone Magus, you fight a dozen ghosts it used to know.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chain">
    <line>Some bind themselves in iron—to limit their own power. Or to show off. Both, maybe.</line>
    <line>Chains clink before they strike. Listen well, and you might survive the first curse.</line>

    <line>A cork’s not just a stopper—it's a guardian! I’ve seen corks as old as ancient wines.</line>

    <line>A jug is just a bottle grown stout! But I confess, they lack a certain elegance. Do you prefer flasks?</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flask">
    <line>Flasks fit neatly in the pocket, but where’s the artistry? Still, they have their place—like in a traveling kit.</line>

    <line>A fresh brew in a new bottle! The brewer’s craft and the glassmaker’s art, side by side.</line>

  <entry keyword="wine">
    <line>Wine is just an excuse for a better bottle, I say. Though, I’ve heard of bottles that sing when uncorked. Just a legend, I’m sure.</line>
    <line>Wine bottles are often reused by cunning collectors. But my collection is strictly for display!</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="display">
    <line>A display of bottles shines brightest in the morning sun. Glass of every hue, glinting like treasure!</line>

  <entry keyword="ocean">
    <line>The ocean has swallowed more bottles than any cellar. Who knows what stories drift beneath the waves?</line>

    <line>Ever used a bottle as a candlestick? The wax drips are like a record of long, cozy evenings.</line>
    <line>Bottles make perfect candleholders in a pinch. The light dances through the glass, enchanting!</line>

    <line>Every bottle casts a different shadow. I sometimes sketch them for inspiration.</line>
    <line>Shadows from bottles at sunset can look like towers and castles. Try it sometime!</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="alchemy">
    <line>Alchemists say the bottle is as important as the potion. A flawed bottle means disaster!</line>

    <line>Stoppers come in wood, glass, or silver. I once owned one carved like a dragon’s head!</line>

    <line>A bottle’s best friend? A dust cloth! Sometimes I think they attract dust just for company.</line>

  <entry keyword="antique">
    <line>An antique bottle is more than old glass—it’s a piece of someone’s life. Handle with care.</line>

    <line>Once, I bid all my savings on a bottle... only to find a crack! Such is the risk of collecting.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="friend">
    <line>Some of my best friends are fellow collectors. We trade bottles, and sometimes, secrets.</line>

    <line>A good bottle can hide a secret—double walls, false bottoms. Some even used for smuggling!</line>
    <line>My greatest secret? I once hid a treasure map in a bottle... and then promptly lost it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tower">
    <line>A tower of bottles? Now, that would be an accident waiting to happen! Far better to line them up neatly.</line>

    <line>I thought it was madness. Then I found claw marks on the anvil.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hollow">
    <line>They sound hollow when you strike them. Like drums filled with hate.</line>
    <line>Don’t be fooled. That hollowness is where your screams echo back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dust">
    <line>They don’t bleed. They crumble. But even their dust cuts deep.</line>
    <line>Bronze dust in the lungs makes you dream of anvils falling. I don’t sleep anymore.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>They make a kind of music when they move. Not melody. Something worse.</line>
    <line>My forge used to sing. Now I only hear *their* song.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="statics">
    <line>Get near them and your hair rises. The air *hates* you being close.</line>
    <line>It’s like standing beside a storm held in shape by memory.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="memory">
    <line>They remember. Not like men—but they do. That’s why they return to the same killing grounds.</line>
    <line>My forge was burned out. Weeks later, one came back to stare at the ashes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ruins">
    <line>Old ruins attract them. Maybe they feed on forgotten pride.</line>
    <line>Where the empire fell, bronze now walks. A cruel echo of glory.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weight">
    <line>They’re heavy, but they move like dancers. Makes the first blow surprising.</line>
    <line>Every footfall feels like a verdict. They weigh more than they should—like guilt.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="crack">
    <line>I cracked one once. Took four swings and a prayer. It screamed like a storm hitting metal.</line>
    <line>Cracks are the only proof they can die. That and the silence after.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="forgefire">
    <line>The flames never burn right after a fight with one. Like they take something from the air.</line>
    <line>I lit a forge with their core once. It burned green. Everything it touched turned brittle.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="core">
    <line>Some say they have a core of beating copper. I say it’s resentment given shape.</line>
    <line>You break them, you find the core—still humming, even in death.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chant">
    <line>There’s a chant they murmur—so low it’s more felt than heard.</line>
    <line>I mapped their sounds once. The pattern looked like a sigil. Then the page burned itself.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="truth">
    <line>Bronze doesn’t lie. It just doesn’t *care* what you think the truth is.</line>
    <line>The truth is, I still love the metal. Even if it killed everything else I loved.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ruin">
    <line>They don’t kill for survival. They kill to unmake. Everything we build, they hate.</line>
    <line>My forge, my home, my life—all ruined by a thing made to reflect our greatness. Irony forged in bronze.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glow">
    <line>When they glow, they’re charging. Or remembering. Either way—move.</line>
    <line>That bronze glow? It’s not heat. It’s hunger. Metal wants to feed too.</line>

<trait name="Brume Scholar" priority="40">
  <entry keyword="brume">
    <line>They are beauty. They are horror. They drift through the world like forgotten thoughts.</line>
    <line>Corporeal Brumes… shape without shape, bodies born of grief. I've studied them for decades.</line>
    <line>Most run from the mist. I walk into it. Every Brume has a story—I just prefer to kill the endings.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mist">
    <line>The mist isn't just air. It's memory, emotion, sometimes agony. The Brumes breathe it like we breathe lies.</line>
    <line>Mist clings to them like regret. If you feel cold and hear whispering, you're already too close.</line>
    <line>Mist doesn't just follow them. It *makes* them. Or maybe they *are* it. Still unclear. Still deadly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>They linger near sorrow—battlefields, graveyards, forgotten homes. Places where emotions ferment.</line>
    <line>Brumes don’t eat. They feed on presence. Stand still, and you’re a feast.</line>
    <line>They don’t sleep. They *remember*. And remembering hurts them. That’s why they scream.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hate">
    <line>I loved a mage once. She tried to touch the mind of a Brume. Now her thoughts are scattered across a valley.</line>
    <line>They took her. No wound. No body. Just... gone. Left me with screams and mist in my lungs.</line>
    <line>I hate them not because they kill—but because they *unmake*. That’s worse. That’s theft of the soul.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weakness">
    <line>Light disrupts them. Pure light—sunlight, spellfire, essence flame. It breaks their cohesion.</line>
    <line>They hate music. Not sound—music. Harmony confuses them, like it doesn’t belong.</line>
    <line>Disbelief weakens them. If you deny them, doubt them, their forms flicker. Just before the screaming starts.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="slay" itemType="KillQuestScroll" ctorArgs="CorporealBrume,1,12000">
    <line>If you really wish to understand the Brumes, then destroy what I cannot: the Corporeal one that haunts the Weeping Hollow.</line>
    <line>Talk is wind. Face the Brume. Kill it. And maybe, just maybe, I’ll sleep through a night.</line>
    <line>Bring me the death of the Corporeal Brume. This scroll will know when it falls. I won’t celebrate. But I’ll finally exhale.</line>

  <!-- Red Herrings and Flavor -->

  <entry keyword="memory">
    <line>Brumes echo memory. Not yours—the place’s. They remember what the land forgot.</line>
    <line>Step too deep into Brume fog and you’ll remember things that never happened to you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weeping">
    <line>The Weeping Hollow was peaceful once. Now the trees cry blood. The Brume is growing stronger.</line>
    <line>No birds sing in the Weeping Hollow. Only wind and weeping. And worse, when night falls.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="soul">
    <line>They don’t just haunt the body. They erode the soul. Like wind on stone, slow but certain.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen souls flicker and vanish when Brumes pass through. Like candles snuffed by thought.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eyes">
    <line>Don’t look directly into their eyes. Not because they see you—but because you’ll see them. *All* of them.</line>
    <line>One scholar stared into a Brume’s eyes and began speaking in reverse. Died smiling. I still hear it sometimes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>There’s a melody they hum, low and sour. Like wind caught in ribs. It gets louder when they’re near.</line>
    <line>Some say Brumes once sang lullabies to the dying. I say they mock the living now.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>You can’t summon them with rituals. But pain, sorrow, and silence—that’ll do it.</line>
    <line>They don’t like being summoned. That’s why summoners don’t last long.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="void">
    <line>Brumes are from here, but also not. They’re echoes of something that slipped between worlds.</line>
    <line>They bleed the void. Not black, but *absence*. Where it touches you, you stop existing for a moment.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Fire works, but not just any flame. It must be *real*. Symbolic fire only makes them laugh. Yes—they laugh.</line>
    <line>Brume bodies burn strangely. No smoke. Just light, and then... less air in the room.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grief">
    <line>They gather where grief pools. Not tears—*grief*. There’s a difference.</line>
    <line>You ever feel someone crying and you don’t know why? That’s Brume territory.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>A Brume’s reflection lies. If you see one smiling, run.</line>
    <line>Mirrors crack around them. Not from weight—just presence.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ash">
    <line>They don’t leave corpses—just ash. Cold, tasteless, and unnerving in its silence.</line>
    <line>I sifted through Brume ash once. Found a tooth that wasn't mine. Still don't know whose it was.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>The wind shifts when they’re near—not louder, just... deliberate.</line>
    <line>You can’t trap the wind. But you can follow it. That’s how I first found them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lamp">
    <line>My lamp flickers near them. Not from wind—from indecision. The flame wants to flee.</line>
    <line>Some say Brumes are drawn to light. Others say they fear it. The truth is stranger: they *envy* it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>They whisper in dead languages. Or unborn ones. Either way, my ears bleed when I try to translate.</line>
    <line>Their whispers change meaning the longer you listen. The last one said my name backwards.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cloak">
    <line>I wear a heavy cloak not for warmth—but to hide the shaking.</line>
    <line>My cloak used to be white. Then a Brume passed through me. Now it's shadow-stained.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>I tried to draw one once. The ink fled the page. Literally. Ran off like rain on stone.</line>
    <line>Notes written near Brumes fade, even when carved into stone. They resist record. Like a lie that’s too proud to die.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bottle">
    <line>I trapped a bit of Brume mist in a bottle once. It hums when I'm sad.</line>
    <line>The bottle broke. The room hasn’t felt the same since. Neither have I.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="stairs">
    <line>They don’t like stairs. Not because they can’t climb—but because they *remember falling*.</line>
    <line>You hear heavy steps on wooden stairs in an empty house? Might be one trying to remember how people walked.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lantern">
    <line>Lantern light warps near them—casts shadows of things that aren't there.</line>
    <line>My lantern once cast *two* of my shadows. The second one waved when I didn’t.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="laugh">
    <line>They laugh like crying backwards. You’ll know it when you hear it—and you’ll wish you hadn’t.</line>
    <line>Once, a Brume laughed at me. My ears rang for hours, and my dreams haven’t been the same.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hunger">
    <line>They don’t eat—but they still hunger. For what? I think... warmth. Or certainty.</line>
    <line>A Brume doesn’t consume flesh—it erases you from memory. Ask my apprentice. No, wait… what apprentice?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clock">
    <line>Time bends around them. Clocks stop. Candles burn backward.</line>
    <line>A pocketwatch I wore near one now ticks counterclockwise. I’ve stopped checking the hour.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pages">
    <line>Books decay faster near them. Not rot—disgust. The pages seem to *reject* meaning.</line>
    <line>A journal I kept near a Brume rewrote itself. Now it’s just the same phrase over and over: 'Don’t forget me.'</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cold">
    <line>It’s not regular cold. It’s the cold of being forgotten. Of being nothing.</line>
    <line>Frost forms on bones near them. Even fresh ones. Even *yours*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="child">
    <line>Some say they mimic the cries of children. Others say those cries are what *made* them.</line>
    <line>A child once vanished in the mist. Came back smiling, silent, and wrong.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="veil">
    <line>Brumes thin the veil. Between worlds, between minds, between lives.</line>
    <line>The veil tears around them. If you hear your name in your sleep, it may already be too late.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="needle">
    <line>One scholar tried to sew Brume mist into a doll. That doll now talks. Alone. In locked drawers.</line>
    <line>The Brume’s touch feels like needles in your thoughts. Not pain—just *editing*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="breath">
    <line>You can’t hear them breathe. But sometimes they take *yours*.</line>
    <line>One Brume exhaled on me. I forgot my mother’s name for an hour. I cried anyway.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="candle">
    <line>Brumes pass and candles die. Not extinguished—just... unlit. As if they were never lit.</line>
    <line>I lit a hundred candles around me once. The Brume made them all cry wax like tears.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bell">
    <line>The sound of a bell keeps them at bay—for a moment. But only if rung by someone without regret.</line>
    <line>I rang a bell near a Brume. It cracked. I still hear the ringing, but the bell's long gone.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="torch">
    <line>Carry a torch if you must, but enchant it. Natural flame only delays them.</line>
    <line>Once had a torch scream when a Brume approached. It still flickers on its own, years later.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="madness">
    <line>You don’t go mad from them. You *understand* them—and the understanding breaks you.</line>
    <line>Madness is a kindness compared to what Brumes give you: memory that doesn’t belong.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gift">
    <line>They sometimes leave gifts. Teeth. Notes. Drawings in ash. None of them welcome.</line>
    <line>If you find something beautiful and inexplicable near mist, burn it. Brumes love tokens.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fog">
    <line>Natural fog is soft. Brume fog feels thick, like walking through regret.</line>
    <line>Don’t trust fog that flows uphill. That’s Brume fog. Turn back.</line>

    <line>Hate? No, no. I *loathe*. There's a difference. One comes with study.</line>

  <entry keyword="cantaloupe">
    <line>Ah, the humble cantaloupe—jewel of the melon family! Care to learn what makes it so special?</line>
    <line>Cantaloupe: sweet, fragrant, and full of secrets. Shall we speak of its rind or its flesh first?</line>
    <line>Few fruits rival the cantaloupe’s charm. Tell me, do you know why its aroma is so intoxicating?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="aroma">
    <line>The cantaloupe’s aroma is loaded with esters—nature’s perfume! But its sweetness comes from its sugars.</line>
    <line>That fragrance you smell? Linalool and geranyl acetate working in harmony. Yet taste tells another tale.</line>
    <line>A melon’s bouquet hints at ripeness. But true connoisseurs seek the perfect balance of sugar and acid.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sweetness">
    <line>Sweetness in cantaloupe is measured by Brix—degrees of sugar delight. But texture matters, too.</line>
    <line>A high Brix reading means saccharine bliss. Still, without that yielding flesh, it’s only half the story.</line>
    <line>Sugar is but one facet. A cantaloupe’s true pleasure lies in its succulent, velvety bite.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flesh">
    <line>Velvety orange flesh, each cell bursting with juice. But what gives it that vibrant hue?</line>
    <line>Carotenoids—beta-carotene chiefly—give cantaloupe its color and healthful punch.</line>
    <line>Bite into its flesh and you taste sunlight captured in fruit. Have you tried its juice in potions?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="juice">
    <line>Cantaloupe juice makes a superb base for elixirs—refreshing and restorative.</line>
    <line>Distill the juice, and you get a nectar fit for sachets and tonics alike.</line>
    <line>Some use it in perfumery, others in wine blends. But what of its culinary uses?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="elixir">
    <line>An elixir of cantaloupe soothes the thirstiest adventurer. Yet there’s more to its virtues.</line>
    <line>They say a draught cures fatigue—thanks to its electrolytes and vitamins.</line>
    <line>Fatigue fades when you sip that elixir, but strength lies in its seeds as well.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="seeds">
    <line>Seeds—tiny powerhouses of oils and nutrients. Roasted, they rival any nut.</line>
    <line>I press them for oil in my tinctures. But the rind yields another wonder.</line>
    <line>Collect the seeds and you glimpse the cantaloupe’s full potential. But have you studied the rind?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rind">
    <line>The rind’s netted skin protects and preserves—ideal for pickles and candied treats.</line>
    <line>Some artisans carve it into vessels, believing the patterns guide good fortune.</line>
    <line>A rind repurposed becomes bowls and incense holders. Yet true mastery calls for the vine.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vine">
    <line>Cantaloupe vines crave warm soil and sun—just like the forge craves heat.</line>

    <line>Melonade—a refreshing twist on lemonade! Yet it’s not quite the concentrate I need.</line>

  <entry keyword="festival">
    <line>There’s a melon festival in town, but it’s crowded and the fruits won’t be fresh for me.</line>

    <line>They groom obsessively. Even killers need to shine, it seems.</line>

  <entry keyword="tracks">
    <line>BloodFox tracks look like ink stains—sharp, pointed, precise. Follow them only if you’re ready to die.</line>
    <line>They walk in loops. You follow long enough, you might find yourself being hunted.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="howl">
    <line>They don’t howl. They scream silence. You hear it in your bones, not your ears.</line>
    <line>A howl means ‘stay away.’ A BloodFox never gives you that kindness.</line>

  <entry keyword="tail">
    <line>Their tails sway like dancers—hypnotic. Hunters who stare too long tend to stop breathing.</line>
    <line>The tail’s the cleanest part. Everything else is a blade with fur.</line>

  <entry keyword="eyes">

  <entry keyword="scent">
    <line>They smell of copper and ash. You never forget it—like burnt hope.</line>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>BloodFoxes don’t *kill*—they perform. Ritual. Precision. Reverence. Like death is an offering.</line>
    <line>They circle their prey three times before striking. It’s not instinct. It’s intention.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>Their tracks remind me of spilled ink. Poetic, sure. But what poem ends in screaming?</line>

    <line>A BloodFox wound closes fast. On the *outside*. Inside, the damage lingers. Like regret.</line>

  <entry keyword="eye contact">
    <line>Don’t look one in the eye. Not because it’s rude—because it *sees* too much.</line>

  <entry keyword="mimicry">
    <line>I’ve heard one mimic a child’s voice. Called for help. Lured a dozen men to their deaths.</line>

  <entry keyword="collar">
    <line>Some mad baron tried to tame one. Put a collar on it. Found the collar full of his teeth the next day.</line>
    <line>You don’t leash the wind, and you don’t collar a BloodFox. Unless you want a very short story.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tongue">
    <line>Their tongues feel like sand. That’s not grooming—it’s sanding memories away.</line>
    <line>A cat licked my hand once. I lost the feeling in my fingers for a week.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whiskers">
    <line>Their whiskers twitch in dreams. That’s when they remember *who they were*.</line>
    <line>A whisker in your bed isn’t shedding. It’s a message.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleeping">
    <line>They sleep in impossible places. Walls. Ceilings. Inside closed cabinets.</line>
    <line>Don’t wake a cat. They return the favor when *you* sleep.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="circle">
    <line>Draw a circle, and they sit in it. No matter where, or why.</line>
    <line>I once found a ring of cats around a perfect circle. Still don’t know what was in it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sneeze">
    <line>Cats hate sneezes. It disrupts their focus. Or alerts them to weakness.</line>
    <line>I sneezed once. It stared for an hour like I’d insulted its ancestors.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="stare">
    <line>Cats stare not at you—but *through* you. Into some quiet part you forgot existed.</line>
    <line>I tried to out-stare one once. I don’t remember the hour after that.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tailtip">
    <line>Just the tip of the tail moves? That’s *delightful malice*.</line>
    <line>A twitching tail tip means something’s about to fall. Possibly you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grave">
    <line>I saw a cat sleeping on a fresh grave. Then the dirt shifted.</line>
    <line>Cats know where the dead lie. They nap to remember.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lineage">
    <line>They claim descent from lions. I think it's closer to demons.</line>
    <line>Purebred? No. *Pure-evil-bred*, perhaps.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feet">
    <line>They target feet first. It’s psychological.</line>
    <line>Covered my feet in armor. They bit my elbow instead. Adaptable beasts.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="doorway">
    <line>They pause in doorways to listen. Or to calculate your weakness.</line>
    <line>I stepped over one. It followed for three weeks. Never blinked.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="plant">
    <line>They chew plants to test them. Not for taste—for *reaction*.</line>
    <line>My herbalist friend gave one catnip. It hasn't stopped laughing since.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glass">
    <line>They drink from your glass not because it’s yours—but because it *is* yours.</line>
    <line>Spilled wine. Shattered goblet. One cat. No remorse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tongueout">
    <line>They leave their tongues out sometimes. It's not cute—it's how they mock us.</line>
    <line>A cat sat there, tongue out, staring. I checked the water. It was *wrong*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="heel">
    <line>They follow at your heel, not out of loyalty. They’re measuring stride length.</line>
    <line>A cat behind you is closer than it appears. Always has been.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>Cats circle objects three times before sitting. Some say it’s a *binding*. I don’t disagree.</line>
    <line>Every pattern in their steps has meaning. Every nap—an omen.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nap">
    <line>Don’t disturb a napping cat. It’s recharging... or summoning.</line>
    <line>They nap where power gathers. Books, hearths, your pillow.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>I once heard one whisper. Yes—whisper. I wasn’t the same after.</line>
    <line>They meow to you. But among themselves? Much quieter things.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="return">
    <line>Let a cat out—it returns. But is it the *same* one?</line>
    <line>Mine came back with different eyes. Same name. Different rules.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bath">
    <line>They clean themselves endlessly. Not for hygiene—for *purity*.</line>
    <line>A cat’s bath ritual is part grooming, part *banishment*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="revenge">
    <line>I don’t hate them out of spite. I hate them because they *remember*.</line>
    <line>Revenge is the only language they respect. So I speak it. Fluently.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="food">
    <line>They want fresh meat. Spoiled meat. *Your* meat, if you die slow enough.</line>
    <line>I once cooked for five cats. They ignored it and ate a mouse instead. Still alive.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>Their gaze is cold. Calculating. They don’t blink unless they *mean* it.</line>
    <line>A cat’s stare lingers in the mind. Like something testing your soul.</line>

    <line>Ah, the centaur—half-horse, half-man, all arrogance.</line>
    <line>Majestic. Deadly. And deeply untrustworthy. I learned that the hard way.</line>

  <entry keyword="grace">
    <line>Their movements are poetry in motion. Even when trampling you.</line>
    <line>Grace like flowing water—until the arrow comes.</line>
    <line>They run like wind over grass, never stumbling. Never hesitating. That’s what makes them so dangerous.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="betrayal">
    <line>They invited me to their sacred grove. I brought wine. They brought spears.</line>
    <line>I offered knowledge. They offered lies. Then took both.</line>
    <line>I once believed in peace. A centaur taught me that peace is a horse-laugh in the dark.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="culture">
    <line>Their songs speak of stars, blood, and the pulse of the earth. I still hear them in my sleep.</line>
    <line>They mark their rites with dance and fire—but outsiders are never welcome past the first verse.</line>
    <line>They build nothing permanent. All is ritual, all is story. And all of it ends with your bones beneath their hooves.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="anatomy">
    <line>Double lungs. Reinforced spine. Can gallop through a volley and never lose rhythm.</line>
    <line>Their heart is nearly three times the size of ours. Which only means more rage when it breaks.</line>
    <line>Their ribs protect nothing. Strike true, and you can sever breath from bone.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>They bathe in moonlight, not water. Claim it cleanses spirit, not stink.</line>
    <line>Nocturnal when hunted. Diurnal when hunting. Adaptable. Too adaptable.</line>
    <line>They braid their manes before battle. It’s not vanity. It’s tradition—every knot a vow.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="revenge">
    <line>This isn’t vengeance. It’s correction. Balance. Blood for blood and hoof for hoof.</line>
    <line>They took my apprentice. I’ll take their pride, limb by limb.</line>
    <line>I don’t hunt them out of hate. I hunt them because I *once* loved them.</line>

  <!-- Red Herrings & Flavor -->

  <entry keyword="hoof">
    <line>Their hooves leave no print in sacred ground. It’s not magic—it’s arrogance.</line>
    <line>I’ve collected over thirty hooves. Still haven’t found the one that kicked my faith out of me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="forest">
    <line>The forest bends for them. Trees seem to lean aside as they pass. I’ve watched it.</line>
    <line>Centaurs claim no land, but they guard the wild like kings with no thrones.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="archery">
    <line>Their arrows whisper before they kill. That’s all the warning you’ll get.</line>
    <line>They string their bows with sinew from wolves. Poetic, isn’t it?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mane">
    <line>A centaur’s mane tells you their age. The older they are, the more silver. The more silver, the more kills.</line>
    <line>They oil their manes with bark sap. Sticky, sweet, and oddly flammable.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>Their songs travel miles through forest wind. Some say the trees echo them in grief.</line>
    <line>Once, I sang with them. Now I stuff my ears when I hear their dirge. It's not meant for me anymore.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="treaty">
    <line>There was a treaty. Once. Then a centaur broke it—and my ribs.</line>
    <line>Paper means nothing to hooves. Treaties burn. Just like their trust.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="artifact">
    <line>They hide relics in root-caves, guarded by riddles and poison ivy. Centaurs love both.</line>
    <line>I traded three artifacts for peace. They took them—and sent back one. Broken.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wine">
    <line>They love elderberry wine. Not for the taste—it's ceremonial. They pour it over the earth before battle.</line>
    <line>I brought wine to their grove. They poured it out. Said only blood should stain that soil.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="horn">
    <line>They don’t use horns to signal. They use rhythm—hoofbeats in patterns. Listen close, you’ll hear their plans.</line>
    <line>A centaur’s battle horn is carved from fallen stag antler. Every note is a warning... or a farewell.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>They fear uncontrolled fire. It reminds them of a great burning they won’t speak of.</line>
    <line>Their rites end with flame, smoke rising to honor the stars. Then silence. Always silence.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bones">
    <line>They don’t bury their dead. They scatter the bones through the forest. One with the wild, they say.</line>
    <line>Centaur bones are thick. Heavy. Hard to break. I know—I’ve tried.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="herb">
    <line>They chew rootbark soaked in rainwater. It’s both a drug and a memory enhancer, they claim.</line>
    <line>Their herbal mixtures smell of mint, decay, and secrets.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="stars">
    <line>They believe their ancestors became constellations. Look up on a clear night and they’ll name them all.</line>
    <line>I once asked a centaur why they follow stars. He asked why I follow roads.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>Every scar is a story. Centaurs never hide them. They compare them like achievements.</line>
    <line>I carry mine beneath robes. They wear theirs in the open wind. I envy that.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="language">
    <line>They don’t write. Their language is sung, danced, and remembered. No scroll can contain it.</line>
    <line>Tried to transcribe it once. Gave up after my ink froze in fear.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hoofprint">
    <line>Their prints are unique—like fingerprints. Some hunters track them by stride, by weight, by rhythm.</line>
    <line>The ground remembers them long after they pass. I’ve seen flowers bloom in centaur trails.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whistle">
    <line>They don’t speak while stalking. They whistle. Short, sharp, specific—each note a command.</line>
    <line>Once mistook a centaur war-whistle for birdsong. Nearly died admiring it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cloak">
    <line>Centaurs wear cloaks only during mourning. Gray, stitched from bark and hair.</line>
    <line>I kept the cloak of one I slew. Can’t wear it. It feels like betrayal.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flute">
    <line>Their flutes are carved from elderwood. Haunting tones. Makes even wolves pause.</line>
    <line>He played a tune once... even the fire went quiet.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>I once caught a centaur staring into a pond like it was a mirror. It wept. I didn’t ask why.</line>
    <line>They claim reflections lie. That water shows the beast, not the soul.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>Their blood is thick. Smells of soil and smoke. Stains don’t come out easy.</line>
    <line>Bled one once. The grass grew faster where it fell. I stopped watering my garden after that.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tattoo">
    <line>Their skin bears ink from river stones. Each mark earned, not given.</line>
    <line>One bore a tattoo shaped like a falling star. He wouldn’t tell me what it meant. Just stared.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="teeth">
    <line>Centaurs don’t lose teeth—they sharpen them. It’s more ritual than hygiene.</line>
    <line>A centaur’s bite isn’t lethal, but it’s memorable.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>They follow moon cycles for battle, birth, and burial. Especially burial.</line>
    <line>Full moon. That’s when they run. Not from anything—toward something.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="drum">
    <line>Their war drums are made from hollow tree stumps. Sound carries for miles. So does fear.</line>
    <line>If you hear a drumbeat in the forest, you’re either being welcomed... or warned.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="arrow">
    <line>They fletch arrows with crow feathers. Symbol of death. Or trickery. Or both.</line>
    <line>Pulled one of their arrows from a tree. Still humming with magic two days later.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Centaurs don’t like mirrors. Something about shame. Or maybe they just don’t like seeing the human in them.</line>
    <line>I held up a mirror once. It laughed. Then shattered it with a hoof.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="jealousy">
    <line>I envied them once—their strength, their unity, their lore. Now I just envy the dead who never knew them.</line>
    <line>Jealousy fades. Scars don’t.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>I dreamed once of riding with them. Now I dream of fire, hooves, and unanswered apologies.</line>
    <line>They haunt dreams. Not out of cruelty—but because they *remember* you there.</line>

<trait name="Changeling Lorekeeper" priority="50">
  <entry keyword="changeling">
    <line>Changelings are mirrors that lie. They wear your voice, your face—but never your soul.</line>
    <line>They shift, they steal, they *become*. It is both an art and an abomination.</line>
    <line>To study a changeling is to question your own reflection. To fight one? That’s clarity.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mimic">
    <line>They don’t just mimic. They *become*. Your walk, your voice, your memories—if you let them close.</line>
    <line>A changeling mimics what it observes. But there’s always a flaw. A twitch. A hesitation. Learn to see it.</line>
    <line>I once saw one mimic a bard so well, it performed at his funeral. Took us a week to realize he was the *wrong* corpse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="identity">
    <line>What are you if something else can wear your life better than you?</line>
    <line>Changelings don’t just take forms. They steal meaning. Relationships. Trust.</line>
    <line>If you don’t know who you are, a changeling will gladly decide for you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hate">
    <line>Hate? No. It’s deeper. Like cutting out a splinter that learned to speak.</line>
    <line>One wore my sister’s face for two years. She was already dead. It smiled while I grieved.</line>
    <line>Hate isn't enough. What I feel? It’s devotion—to *undo* every one of them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="study">
    <line>Years of watching. Learning. Spotting the cracks in their disguises.</line>
    <line>You must never trust the eyes. Only habits. A changeling forgets the little things.</line>
    <line>I keep notes. Drawings. Echoes of their errors. It’s the only way to fight a lie.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="slay" itemType="KillQuestScroll" ctorArgs="Changeling,8,9000">
    <line>I can’t cleanse the past. But I can end their future. Bring me the bodies of eight Changelings.</line>

    <line>Talk is cheap. Show me you understand the cost of deception. Bring me eight Changelings—dead, not mimicked.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Red Herrings & Flavor Dialogue -->

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Never trust a mirror. Not in changeling lands. It shows more than your reflection.</line>
    <line>A mirror cracked once when I stared too long. Either I saw too much—or it saw me first.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="voice">
    <line>A changeling’s voice *almost* matches. But if you close your eyes, the rhythm’s wrong.</line>
    <line>Heard my father call my name from the woods. He’s been dead ten years. I didn’t follow.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eyes">
    <line>The eyes never match the emotion. They smile with lips. Not with gaze.</line>
    <line>Real eyes remember pain. Changelings forget it in the performance.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fear">
    <line>Fear is a tell they struggle with. You can mimic courage. Fear is... instinct.</line>
    <line>They don’t fear death. Just exposure. Unmasking them is a wound they can’t hide.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="skin">
    <line>Their skin feels too smooth. Too perfect. It lacks scars, wrinkles—life.</line>
    <line>Once I grabbed one mid-shift. Flesh like melting wax. I still feel it sometimes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smile">
    <line>A changeling’s smile is too wide. Too deliberate. Like they practiced it too long.</line>
    <line>If the smile comes too early, too easily—it’s not human. It's rehearsed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="memory">
    <line>They get the big things right. But ask them how they met you—and they stumble.</line>
    <line>Memories are hard to fake. Personal ones even harder. It’s where their mask cracks.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>Changelings hum lullabies they’ve never heard. Old songs, wrong tempos.</line>
    <line>Music lingers in them. Like echoes. Off-key echoes, but dangerous all the same.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>Sometimes they echo voices they’ve heard before—by accident. Creepiest in silence.</line>
    <line>In caves, their echoes speak back. Not words you said—but words you *thought*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lost">
    <line>Too many people I’ve loved are ‘missing’. I check their replacements weekly.</line>
    <line>Every ‘missing’ poster is a gamble. Maybe they’re gone. Maybe they *changed*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="truth">
    <line>Truth is the one thing they can’t hold. It burns. Warps. Unravels their lies.</line>
    <line>I carry a truthstone. If it hums, I ask more questions. If it sings—I draw my blade.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tears">
    <line>A changeling can cry. But not at the right moments.</line>
    <line>I once saw one cry laughing. Convincing—until I remembered the real person *never* laughed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="touch">
    <line>Their touch is light. As if afraid they’ll absorb too much. Or give something away.</line>
    <line>Hold their hand long enough, and you’ll feel the tremble—like static beneath skin.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>They shift better under moonlight. It’s poetic. And horrifying.</line>
    <line>The moon sees them. Don’t ask me how I know. Just watch the shadows next time.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Their shadows flicker wrong. Like they're remembering which shape to cast.</line>
    <line>If the shadow moves before the body, leave the room. Slowly. No sudden motions.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>I don’t dream anymore. Not since one of them visited my sleep wearing *me*.</line>
    <line>Changelings don't sleep. They mimic sleep. That’s how my brother caught one—by snoring *back*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="breath">
    <line>They breathe, but not like we do. No rhythm. Just enough to pass.</line>
    <line>In winter, they forget to make breath mist. That’s how I spotted one in the snow.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="touchstone">
    <line>I carry a touchstone. Cold to truth, warm to mimicry. It hums when near one of *them*.</line>
    <line>Not many know about touchstones. Fewer survive using them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>Old rituals keep them at bay. Salt, ash, and truth written in blood. Mine, not theirs.</line>
    <line>It’s not the ritual that works—it’s the intent. They *feel* belief. Like pain.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>They whistle in the wind. Not their mouths—just... them. A whisper echo no one else hears.</line>
    <line>Once heard a changeling echo carried on the breeze. It repeated my name—backward.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eyesight">
    <line>Don’t trust your eyes. Train your *ears*. Sound is harder to copy than shape.</line>
    <line>I wear smoked glass lenses now. Keeps their shimmer from seeping into my mind.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="food">
    <line>They eat, but don’t savor. It’s performance. They chew like a child imitating hunger.</line>
    <line>Caught one trying to mimic soup. Didn’t know it needed a *bowl*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="reflection">
    <line>They avoid water. Not because it burns—because it *tells*. Reflection doesn't lie.</line>
    <line>One saw itself once—truly saw—and screamed for hours. Shattered every window in the house.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="perfume">
    <line>Scent confuses them. Not used to real smell. That's why I wear ink and iron.</line>
    <line>A changeling reeking of lilac gave itself away. The man it copied was allergic.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="songbird">
    <line>Songbirds stop singing around them. Nature knows its own—and what isn't.</line>
    <line>If the birds go silent, check your companions. Something's wrong.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clock">
    <line>They miscount time. Minutes too long. Hours too short. As if they’re syncing to another rhythm.</line>
    <line>Ever watch a changeling wind a clock? It hesitates. As if time were optional.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="coin">
    <line>I flip a coin when I meet strangers. Real people catch it. Changelings... adjust.</line>
    <line>They don’t like metal. Conducts too much truth. Or maybe too little lie.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="story">
    <line>Ask for a childhood story. Real folk grin. Changelings improvise—and badly.</line>
    <line>Everyone remembers a scar story. Changelings pause. As if they’ve never bled honestly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="heartbeat">
    <line>Changelings mimic the beat—but not the rhythm. Their hearts stutter under pressure.</line>
    <line>Once heard one fake a heartbeat with a drum. Clever. Wrong cadence, though.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bleed">
    <line>Yes, they bleed. But not red. More like smoke and memory.</line>
    <line>Cut one once. It bled silence. Took hours for the noise to return.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gesture">
    <line>They mimic gestures too well. Too perfect. No hesitation, no human sloppiness.</line>
    <line>Ever see someone wipe a tear before they cry? That’s a tell.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="doppelganger">
    <line>Not all doppelgangers are changelings—but all changelings are liars.</line>
    <line>I once met *two* versions of myself. One was real. I'm still not sure it was me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Fire reveals them. Not burns them—reveals. Shadows twist. Shapes falter.</line>
    <line>If a changeling ever lights a fire, watch how the flames avoid their eyes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="child">
    <line>They steal children not to raise them—but to replace them.</line>
    <line>The worst part? The child they mimic still screams. Somewhere.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lie">
    <line>To them, lies are threads—they weave whole lives from them.</line>
    <line>If a changeling tells you the truth, it’s only to sharpen the next lie.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="name">
    <line>They avoid names. Real names have power. Anchors. Changelings drift too much for that.</line>
    <line>Ask one its name. Watch it hesitate. That pause? That’s your chance.</line>

    <line>A Chaos Dragoon doesn’t retreat. They *calculate* backwards movement.</line>
    <line>They name their swords. Then they *become* the name. That's how deep their madness runs.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="strategy">
    <line>They flank like ghosts and strike like war gods. I’ve seen them outmaneuver armies twice their size.</line>
    <line>Chaos Dragoons feint death. Bait ambushes. Exploit terrain. They study *us* as much as I study *them*.</line>
    <line>Their ranks aren’t random. There’s purpose in every formation—watch the banners, and you live.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="helmet">
    <line>Never seen a Dragoon unmasked. I suspect there’s nothing left beneath the helm but purpose.</line>
    <line>Their helmets are sealed not just to protect, but to hide. Whatever face lies beneath… it's not human anymore.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>To become a Dragoon, they kneel before a flame that never dies. What happens next… isn't spoken of.</line>
    <line>Initiation involves blood—yours and theirs. That’s how they bond to the chaos flame.</line>
    <line>Their rites are half battle, half blasphemy. I watched once. Once was enough.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="betrayal">
    <line>They burned my sister alive for choosing mercy. That’s when I stopped admiring them.</line>
    <line>I trained beside them once. When I hesitated to kill a child, they called me weak. And then they made an example of me.</line>
    <line>My scars aren’t from war—they’re from *trusting* a Dragoon. Never again.</line>

  <entry keyword="armor">
    <line>They don’t polish it. They *anoint* it. Blood and ash make their steel holy.</line>
    <line>Chaos Dragoon armor isn’t forged—it’s *infused*. Madness, iron, and something older.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="banner">
    <line>Their banners scream when they burn. Don’t ask me how I know.</line>
    <line>Each banner marks a victory. Or a massacre. Depends who writes the history.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="discipline">
    <line>Their drills begin before dawn and end after death.</line>
    <line>They worship chaos—but train like monks. That's the contradiction that makes them lethal.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>They burn villages not to win, but to *cleanse*. That’s their word, not mine.</line>
    <line>A Dragoon once told me: 'Fire tells no lies.' Then he set my home alight.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="oath">
    <line>They swear only one oath: 'To serve the chaos within.' Whatever that means, it terrifies me.</line>
    <line>Their oaths aren’t spoken. They’re carved into their bones. Ritual scarring, beneath the armor.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dreams">
    <line>I dream of their voices—metal scraping on metal. Waking is worse.</line>
    <line>They haunt me. In sleep. In thought. I study them to *understand*—and to *end* them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flame">
    <line>The Chaos Flame is not symbolic. It’s literal. And alive. And it watches.</line>
    <line>They carry embers from the First Flame. Burn one, and you’ll see what I mean.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blade">
    <line>Their blades don’t dull. I suspect they drink blood. Or sharpen themselves.</line>
    <line>Each Dragoon names their blade after their first kill. Then they *introduce* it to every enemy after.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="loyalty">
    <line>They aren’t loyal to a king or country. Just the idea of chaos perfected.</line>
    <line>Break a Dragoon’s chain of command, and you’ve got one minute before they re-form. Exactly sixty seconds.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="camp">
    <line>Chaos Dragoon camps are too clean. No waste. No idle noise. Even their fires burn quiet.</line>
    <line>I infiltrated one once. Spent three days hiding in a pit, learning their chants. Still hear them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="truth">
    <line>The truth is, I envy their conviction. But I *loathe* what they do with it.</line>
    <line>Truth died the moment they raised the Chaos Standard. Everything since has been performance.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ashes">
    <line>They scatter ashes on their wounds. Keeps the pain fresh. Helps them *focus.*</line>
    <line>A Chaos Dragoon doesn’t fear death. Only *being forgotten*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>I’ve rewritten my notes on them a hundred times. The ink runs when I write about their faces.</line>
    <line>Dragoon war scrolls use black ash for ink. Easier to burn when retreating.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chant">
    <line>Their chants aren’t words—they’re war rhythms. Hear one too long and your heartbeat changes.</line>
    <line>Each syllable of their chant marks a kill. If you hear five in a row—run.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boot">
    <line>Their boots aren’t leather—they’re reinforced with bone and oathmetal. Crunch louder than they walk.</line>
    <line>You can tell where they’ve marched. The ground still remembers the weight.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="coin">
    <line>Dragoons don’t carry coin. They carry tokens—faces of their enemies, etched in iron.</line>
    <line>I once found a Chaos coin. It hummed. I buried it. Still hums some nights.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smoke">
    <line>Dragoons use smoke like wolves use the dark—cover, confusion, and then blood.</line>
    <line>Their camps always smell like burned paper and broken oaths.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dog">
    <line>They train hounds to bite silence. No bark, no growl—just strike.</line>
    <line>Saw a Dragoon hound once. It had no eyes. Didn't need them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>They scar their hearts with knives before battle. Some say it's how they feel less pain.</line>
    <line>A Dragoon’s scar map is a diary. Read it, and you'll wish you hadn’t.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="book">
    <line>I wrote a book once—*Inside the Mind of a Dragoon*. No one’s read it and remained whole.</line>
    <line>Their libraries are filled with torn banners and blood. No books. Just memories nailed to walls.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="helmet">
    <line>You want to know why they never take off the helmet? Neither do I. That’s why I’m still sane.</line>
    <line>Their helmets whisper back, you know. After the battle. When it's quiet.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>It’s not just spilled—it’s measured. Every strike, every wound, part of some cruel equation.</line>
    <line>They don’t clean their blades. Let the blood harden—it’s part of the ritual.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>Even the wind bends around a Chaos Dragoon. Like it fears disrupting their silence.</line>
    <line>Wherever they go, the wind dies first. Then the birds. Then everything else.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="drum">
    <line>Chaos Dragoons don’t use war drums. Their *march* is the drum.</line>
    <line>I once heard them beat a rhythm on shields before charging. It didn’t echo—it *lingered*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="path">
    <line>They leave no footprints—just scars in the land.</line>
    <line>A Dragoon's path is never straight. Chaos is a spiral, and so are they.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rain">
    <line>Rain slicks their armor but never dims their eyes. Ever see a man drown without water? I have.</line>
    <line>They say the rain turns red when Dragoons fall. I’ve seen it. I still don’t believe it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bell">
    <line>They don’t use bells for funerals. Just silence. Worse than mourning.</line>
    <line>A Dragoon’s bell tolls backward. Don’t ask how—I still hear it in my sleep.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="torch">
    <line>Torches go out near their camps. Not by wind. By *decision*.</line>
    <line>Once I carried a torch into their crypt. Flame turned blue. Whispered. Never burned right again.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ice">
    <line>You think chaos is all fire? Try staring down a Dragoon who doesn’t blink in a blizzard.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen them wade through frozen rivers like they were smoke. No shiver. No soul.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feast">
    <line>Dragoons don’t feast. They consume. Fast. Efficient. Like war itself.</line>
    <line>I once saw their 'banquet.' Just silence, masks, and a single knife passed around. No food.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clock">
    <line>They fight by time, not impulse. Every motion measured. Like gears in a death machine.</line>
    <line>One Dragoon carried a pocketwatch. It ticked louder than his heartbeat.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Never show them a mirror. They don’t cast reflections—they cast memories.</line>
    <line>I found one polishing a shard of mirror. Asked him what he saw. He said, 'My last mistake.'</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="steel">
    <line>They believe steel is sacred. Not forged, but *earned* through ritual.</line>
    <line>Their steel sings when it strikes. Some say it remembers the blood it spilled.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ghosts">
    <line>I’ve seen their ghosts. Pale echoes in old battlefields. They don't rest. They *wait*.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chaos">
    <line>Chaos is their god, but they follow it like zealots. There’s no room for mercy in that doctrine.</line>
    <line>They claim chaos is freedom. What they truly serve is slaughter in perfect formation.</line>
    <line>The Chaos Dragoons march in chaos, but their blades strike in precision.</line>

    <line>A dragoon’s armor shines with blood and oathbinding. Beautiful. Terrible.</line>
    <line>They were elite, once. Now they’re monsters with banners and rules.</line>
    <line>Dragoon means nothing now—just another word for killer draped in ritual.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="elite">
    <line>The Elites train in silence. They kill in silence. Their loyalty is louder than any scream.</line>
    <line>Elite doesn’t mean strong. It means thorough. Precise. Cold.</line>
    <line>Chaos Dragoon Elites have no names. Only ranks. I remember the one that burned my library—Rank V.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="betrayal">
    <line>They burned every book that questioned the war. I burned my uniform and swore vengeance.</line>
    <line>I loved one of them once. She chose duty over me. She would not hesitate to kill me now.</line>
    <line>Their betrayal wasn't personal. That's what makes it worse. They kill because they’re told to.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weakness">
    <line>They rely on formation. Break that, and you break them.</line>
    <line>Arrogance. That’s their weak point. The Elites don’t expect resistance. Show them they’re wrong.</line>
    <line>Flank them. Make them react. They hate reacting. They only know how to *execute*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="uniform">
    <line>They polish their armor with ashes. Makes it shine darker.</line>
    <line>The cloak color marks rank. Black is death. Red is executioner. Gold... gold means command.</line>

  <entry keyword="war">
    <line>They don’t fight wars. They *conduct* them—like music, written in blood.</line>
    <line>I used to call it a noble war. Then I saw the children in the ashes of a 'noble victory.'</line>

    <line>History died in flames that day. I survived only to rewrite it—with a blade.</line>

  <entry keyword="march">

    <line>A Chaos Dragoon doesn’t walk. They *descend*.</line>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>I study them like a mirror. Because once, I believed in what they were.</line>
    <line>They reflect the worst of me. And the best. That’s why I must kill them.</line>

  <entry keyword="oath">
    <line>Their oaths are sealed in blood and fire. Breaking them invites death—or worse, exile.</line>
    <line>I still remember the words. I whisper them sometimes, just to feel the weight again.</line>

  <entry keyword="ash">
    <line>Ash clings to their armor like memory. I’ve seen them polish it into mirrors.</line>
    <line>The ashes of my scrolls still stain my hands. Some things never wash away.</line>

    <line>Their commanders wear silence like a second cloak. Orders come in glances and nods.</line>
    <line>There’s no democracy in Chaos. Just hierarchy and bloodshed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>I used to think ink was more powerful than the sword. Turns out, fire doesn’t care.</line>

    <line>Every page I wrote for them, I regret. But I read them still—so I never forget.</line>
    <line>Regret keeps me warm. It's colder than hate, but lasts longer.</line>

  <entry keyword="armor">
    <line>Their armor’s not just forged—it’s *consecrated*. Makes it harder to kill them. Or forgive them.</line>
    <line>Each dent in their armor tells a story. I helped write too many of them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="footsteps">
    <line>They walk like they’re already dead. No hesitation. No weight.</line>
    <line>You’ll hear them before you see them—metal on stone, like executioners on parade.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="voice">
    <line>They rarely speak. When they do, it's rehearsed. Like a prayer. Or a threat.</line>
    <line>A Dragoon’s voice is trained to command—not to comfort.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="symbol">
    <line>Their symbols twist when you stare too long. Chaos has a way of rewriting meaning.</line>
    <line>The eye they wear isn’t painted—it’s burned into the cloth.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>Every kill is a ritual. Blade angles, blood spatter—it’s choreography, not violence.</line>
    <line>Before battle, they kneel and cut their palms. It's not prayer. It's a contract.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="plume">
    <line>The higher the rank, the darker the plume. Black means command. Red means death.</line>

    <line>I still dream of the academy, before they marched. Before the madness.</line>
    <line>Some nights, I hear them chanting in my sleep. The same three words. Over and over.</line>

  <entry keyword="ashes">
    <line>You think burning books kills knowledge? Ask the Chaos Dragoons. They made it doctrine.</line>
    <line>Ashes don’t forget. They just wait to be stirred.</line>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>Chaos doesn’t demand blood. It *assumes* it.</line>
    <line>There’s a reason their tabards are dark. You don’t see the stains.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blame">
    <line>I blamed myself for years. Then I realized—that’s exactly what they wanted.</line>
    <line>Blame is lighter than guilt. But it cuts deeper.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="legacy">
    <line>They fight for a legacy written in skulls and shadows.</line>
    <line>Every Dragoon believes they’re part of history. None wonder what kind.</line>

  <entry keyword="training">
    <line>They train without rest. Pain is a tutor. Mercy is treason.</line>
    <line>I watched one train until their bones broke. Then thank their commander for the lesson.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silence">
    <line>They weaponize silence. You start to fear the quiet more than the clash.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen them stand in total stillness for hours—waiting for an order, or a reason.</line>

  <entry keyword="feather">
    <line>A single feather in their armor? That's not for flight. It's from the first kill they made.</line>

    <line>Ah, the ChickenLizard! Nature's joke and masterpiece in one feathery, scaly package.</line>
    <line>A marvel of evolution, or chaos. Feathers, scales, talons—none of it makes sense, yet all of it works.</line>
    <line>They are cunning, colorful, and utterly infuriating. Ask me more, I dare you.</line>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>They sleep under warm rocks and scratch the ground in perfect spirals. Spiral behavior! Genius.</line>
    <line>Every morning, they do a sort of dance. I thought it ritualistic. Turns out it was indigestion.</line>

    <line>No two ChickenLizards are alike. I’ve catalogued seventy-three hues. Still haven’t seen 'Cursed Violet' twice.</line>

    <line>Their call is like a shriek filtered through a flute. It haunts me. In my dreams. And my soup.</line>

    <line>Poisonous? No. Repugnant? Yes. Same effect, really.</line>

  <entry keyword="beak">
    <line>The beak isn't for eating. It's for posturing. And biting. Mostly biting.</line>
    <line>Their beak clicks when they're angry. Or aroused. I try not to confuse the two.</line>

  <entry keyword="paper">
    <line>They eat paper. Only important paper. Contracts, research notes, love letters...</line>

    <line>Scratches on the barn door. Names, maybe. Warnings, maybe. Either way, I moved out.</line>
    <line>They scratch the same symbols over and over. Looks like runes. Or maybe recipes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="peck">
    <line>A peck’s not just a bite. It’s a warning. A message. A *test*.</line>
    <line>They peck in threes. Always threes. Like they’re counting something.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eyes">
    <line>Their eyes don’t blink like ours. Just... stare. Like they remember.</line>
    <line>Saw one blink sideways once. Don’t ask me how. It knew I saw.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>There’s a ritual, I swear. They gather in circles. Dance. Chant. Or maybe it’s just clucking. Still terrifying.</line>
    <line>The feathers burned blue. That’s how I knew it wasn’t normal poultry.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>They act strange under the full moon. Stranger than usual, I mean.</line>
    <line>Moonlight makes them bold. Found one standing on my roof just... watching.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nest">
    <line>A nest isn’t just for eggs. It’s a command center.</line>
    <line>Once found a nest built from teeth and twine. No egg. Just a small doll. Looked like me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dirt">
    <line>They dig holes, not for worms—but for secrets. For *things* they don’t want found.</line>
    <line>Dirt around a chicken coop moves different. Like something’s tunneling beneath.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="comb">
    <line>That red comb on their head? That’s not blood. Not their own, anyway.</line>
    <line>I saw one sharpening its comb on a stone. I didn’t sleep for a week.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scratchings">
    <line>They left scratchings on my barn wall. Circles. Arrows. One looked like my house.</line>
    <line>Scratchings in the dirt. They point places. Not safe places.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="claw">
    <line>A chicken’s claw isn’t for balance—it’s for vengeance.</line>
    <line>Still have one claw scar on my calf. It spells something if you squint.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grain_silo">
    <line>They guard the grain silo like it’s sacred. Like a vault of secrets.</line>
    <line>One time I opened the silo and they were all inside. Silent. Just... waiting.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tail">
    <line>They wag their tails when lying. Or when plotting. Hard to tell.</line>
    <line>Tail feathers twitch before a strike. That’s when you *run*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fence">
    <line>A fence doesn’t keep them in. It just delays the betrayal.</line>
    <line>I electrified my fence. Didn’t stop ‘em. One unhooked it. With its beak.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gift">
    <line>They left me a gift once. Dead mouse. Perfectly cleaned. Message received.</line>
    <line>When chickens give gifts, it’s not kindness. It’s currency.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scratchpost">
    <line>They used my scratchpost as a shrine. Hung bones from it. Bird bones.</line>
    <line>It started as a roost. Became something else. Something *sacred* to them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whistle">
    <line>They don’t like whistling. Makes ‘em freeze. Like it’s a command from higher up.</line>
    <line>Whistled once. One tilted its head... like it understood.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="worm">
    <line>You think they eat worms for food? Worms are *messengers*. I’ve seen them whisper.</line>
    <line>They don’t bite the worms. They whisper to them. Then bury them again.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Chickens don’t like mirrors. Shows what they really are. They *know*.</line>
    <line>Held a mirror up to one. It screamed. Or maybe that was me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weather">
    <line>When the storm comes, they get quiet. Like they’re listening to something in the wind.</line>
    <line>Chickens predicted the last lightning strike. Huddled seconds before. Coincidence? Ha.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cloud">
    <line>Clouds shaped like chickens always mean trouble. I don’t look up anymore.</line>
    <line>Once saw a cloud shaped like a feather. The barn caught fire an hour later.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clock">
    <line>They always know the time. Rooster crows are just decoys. Real timing’s in their steps.</line>
    <line>Wound up my clock with a feather once. Time ran backwards all day.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lantern">
    <line>A chicken knocked over my lantern once. Burned down half my shed. Coincidence? Sure.</line>
    <line>Lantern light makes their shadows *stretch*. Too far. Too *thin*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grain">
    <line>Don’t feed them grain. You think it makes them tame. It just makes them stronger.</line>
    <line>I once fed a chicken cursed grain. It blinked at me. Twice.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dinner">
    <line>You ever *eat* a chicken? Tastes like fear and old grudges.</line>
    <line>Roast one if you must—but don’t close your eyes while you chew.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>I sleep with one eye open. The other one’s for dreaming of feathers.</line>
    <line>Don’t sleep near chickens. They whisper while you rest.</line>

  <entry keyword="citrine">
    <line>Ah, citrine! The sunstone of scholars and sages. It’s not just beauty—it’s purpose.</line>
    <line>Citrine—the gem that captures sunlight itself. Do you know its relation to clarity?</line>
    <line>To speak of citrine is to speak of energy. Ever wonder why it’s tied to clarity?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clarity">
    <line>Clarity of thought, clarity of spirit. Citrine sharpens the mind, like focus refined by quartz.</line>
    <line>True clarity begins with focus. And quartz is the key—have you considered its power?</line>
    <line>Clarity through quartz—nature's lens for the mind. A good place to begin, wouldn't you say?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="quartz">
    <line>Quartz is the mother stone—clear, pure, but citrine is its fire-born child.</line>
    <line>Quartz forms the foundation, but citrine emerges with heat and alchemy. Do you see the transformation?</line>
    <line>Through fire and time, quartz becomes citrine. It is the essence of transmutation.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="transmutation">
    <line>Transmutation... it’s what turns common to rare. Just like alchemy, or intent.</line>
    <line>Alchemy teaches us: nothing changes without purpose. Citrine responds to such purpose.</line>
    <line>To transmute is to act with will. Citrine responds well to strong intention. Do you know about willstones?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="willstones">
    <line>Some call citrine a willstone—because it resonates with drive and purpose.</line>
    <line>Willstones like citrine amplify our focus. They’re rare, and require careful attunement. Ever heard of attunement?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="attunement">
    <line>Attunement is a gentle art. One must feel the gem’s frequency. Citrine hums with ambition.</line>
    <line>To attune a citrine is to align with purpose. And when they align—great things happen. There is power in resonance.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="resonance">
    <line>Resonance binds gem and bearer. I seek it for my work. But my collection is incomplete...</line>
    <line>When citrine resonates, its warmth is unmistakable. I require more to continue. Would you help me gather?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gather" itemType="CollectionQuestScroll" ctorArgs="Citrine,30,6000">
    <line>You’ve followed the light well. Bring me 30 citrines, and I shall reward you for your radiant insight.</line>
    <line>So few recognize citrine's full potential. Will you bring me 30? Here—this scroll will guide your way.</line>
    <line>To gather citrine is to carry sunlight in your hands. Bring me 30, and take this parchment—your radiant task begins now.</line>

  <!-- RED HERRING PATH -->

  <entry keyword="gold">
    <line>Many mistake citrine for gold. But gold weighs heavy, while citrine uplifts.</line>
    <line>Gold glitters, yes, but citrine *glows*. Still, some confuse them—often to their detriment. Ever lose a coin?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="coin">
    <line>Coins jingle, citrines sing. A coin may buy bread, but a citrine may buy peace of mind.</line>
    <line>A misplaced coin is easily replaced. Not so with true wealth. Do you think wealth corrupts?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wealth">
    <line>True wealth lies in clarity, not coin. Greed muddies the gem’s glow.</line>
    <line>The wise seek meaning in minerals—not wealth for its own sake. But greed is a common folly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sunlight">
    <line>Sunlight—citrine's muse. Yet the sun gives freely to all, even those who squander it.</line>
    <line>To chase sunlight is noble, but dangerous. Look too long, and you may go blind to the truths in shadow.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glass">
    <line>Glass can shimmer like a gem, but it carries no resonance. Just a hollow shine.</line>
    <line>Many confuse glass with citrine—sad, really. Glass reflects, citrine reveals.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Fire transforms quartz to citrine... or to ash, if left unchecked.</line>
    <line>Fire is both friend and devourer. It tempers stone—or destroys it entirely.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>A mirror shows the face, never the soul. Gems, though... gems whisper secrets.</line>
    <line>Mirrors reflect what we expect. Citrine, what we *need*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>Dreams shaped in citrine often turn lucid. But beware: not all dreams wish you well.</line>
    <line>Some say citrine wards nightmares. Others say it attracts the deeper ones.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sound">
    <line>Crystals hum if you listen closely. Citrine? It sings of warmth and hunger.</line>
    <line>Every gem sings in its own tone. Citrine is the quiet song of focus.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>Sleep near a citrine and wake with purpose—or disquiet. It depends on what stirs inside you.</line>
    <line>I once slept on a bed of raw citrines. The dreams? Vivid. Terrifying. Beautiful.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="desert">
    <line>Citrine grows in places scorched and forgotten. Like wisdom in exile.</line>
    <line>The desert births many treasures—citrine among them. But it buries just as many.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sand">
    <line>Sand is the shattered memory of stone. A thousand citrines might begin this way.</line>
    <line>Some say sand whispers of what it once was. Mountains, crystals, cathedrals of earth.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="aura">
    <line>Auras are tricky. Citrine’s aura is subtle—like ambition kept secret.</line>
    <line>Only those attuned can see a gem’s aura. Citrine burns low but long.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>Citrine doesn’t shout like ruby or command like diamond. It whispers. You must listen closely.</line>
    <line>Sometimes, when all else is silent, you’ll hear it: the whisper of citrine, urging you onward.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="owl">
    <line>Owls and citrine have something in common: they see through illusion.</line>
    <line>The owl sees in darkness, citrine shines through it. Together, they would make a powerful omen.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mask">
    <line>Masks hide the face, but citrine strips them away. It’s... inconvenient for liars.</line>
    <line>Wearing a mask near citrine is like shadow dancing near a bonfire. Eventually, you're seen.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="alchemy">
    <line>Alchemy seeks to change the base into the divine. Citrine is a shortcut... or a trap.</line>
    <line>Some alchemists fear citrine—it shows what they cannot transmute within themselves.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="storm">
    <line>A storm once cracked open a hillside, revealing citrine veins beneath. Beauty through violence.</line>
    <line>Thunder stirs the earth. Citrine awakens under such pressure.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="river">
    <line>Rivers erode the stone, but sometimes they polish a citrine just right.</line>
    <line>They say if you find a citrine in a riverbed, it chose to be there. Waiting for someone like you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Light makes shadow. Citrine, too, casts one. What truths hide behind its glow?</line>
    <line>Citrine’s light is honest. But every gem casts a shadow. Even truth has weight.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="time">
    <line>Time passes through citrine like wind through branches—shaping, never stopping.</line>
    <line>To hold a citrine is to hold eons of waiting. Time moves differently in a crystal’s heart.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="greed">
    <line>Greed draws darkness to even the brightest gem. Citrine resists it, but only barely.</line>
    <line>Greed... it erodes purpose. There are tales of citrines cursed by the touch of greedy hands.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="curse">
    <line>A cursed citrine loses its luster and hum. Such things are best buried.</line>
    <line>Not all glow is good. Some cursed citrines burn cold—better left untouched.</line>

<trait name="Crabologist" priority="40">
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>I’m a crabologist—by passion, not by trade. I study the beasts. I loathe the beasts.</line>
    <line>I used to catalog coastal fauna. Then the Coconut Crabs found me. Now I catalog revenge.</line>
    <line>My job? Obsession. Day and night, I think about them—those monstrous, clicky demons.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="crab">
    <line>Coconut Crabs aren’t crabs. They’re nightmares wrapped in shell and spite.</line>
    <line>They can crack coconuts. Coconuts. You think your bones fare better?</line>
    <line>You hear that clicking at night? That’s not your nerves. That’s them. Watching.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="click">
    <line>Their claws click like bones snapping. You never forget the sound.</line>
    <line>Once, I followed the clicking. Woke up three days later with half a map chewed and one boot gone.</line>
    <line>Click-click-click. The rhythm of coastal horror.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>Nocturnal. Territorial. Hungry. They hoard shiny things and drag off anything that twitches.</line>
    <line>They climb trees to drop down on prey. Yes, climb. Like spiders with armor.</line>
    <line>They hunt in silence until they’re inches from you—then the clicking starts.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weakness">
    <line>They hate citrus. Don’t know why. Toss a lemon—watch them backpedal like cowards.</line>
    <line>Hit the eye stalks. Blinds them. Makes them thrash. Then strike the underbelly—soft as pudding.</line>
    <line>Salt works. Not a lot, just a sprinkle in the right place. Messes with their carapace.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vengeance">
    <line>One took my brother. Just dragged him into the sea like he was driftwood.</line>
    <line>They ruined my research, cracked my boat, and took my toe. I want them ended.</line>
    <line>Revenge is the only science I practice now.</line>

    <line>Think you’re brave? Then prove it. Slay five of those shelled fiends and bring me proof.</line>
    <line>You want my trust? Go crush five Coconut Crabs. Here, take this scroll. It will count the corpses.</line>
    <line>Words mean nothing. Claws mean less. Bring me five dead crabs and maybe I’ll sleep tonight.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Red Herrings and Flavor -->

  <entry keyword="shell">
    <line>They polish their shells with fish oil. That’s not survival—it’s vanity.</line>
    <line>Crack the shell and you’ll find meat. Crack enough, and you’ll find peace.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tree">
    <line>They climb trees. Fall on heads. I wear a helmet in palm groves. You should too.</line>
    <line>Saw one crack a palm tree just to eat the core. Nature’s nightmare fuel.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eyes">
    <line>Those stalked eyes see everything. I once watched one blink in separate directions.</line>
    <line>Their eyes glow in moonlight. If you see two little lanterns, run. Sideways.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="toe">
    <line>Lost a toe. Don’t laugh. Still wakes me up, phantom pinch and all.</line>
    <line>Toe's gone. Clawed clean off. Never found the nail. Still check beaches for it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trap">
    <line>Built traps from rope and rum. They’re greedy—and stupid if you bait 'em right.</line>
    <line>A crab in a trap is worth two out of reach. Unless it eats through the bars. Then run.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="salt">
    <line>Salt irritates their joints. I carry pouches of it. Like a crab exorcist.</line>
    <line>They hate saltwater too long. Strange, for sea creatures. Makes 'em twitchy.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="snack">
    <line>They’ll eat anything. Boots, fish, bones, faces. In that order of preference.</line>
    <line>I caught one munching on a spyglass. Thought it was a treat. Or a challenge.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="claw">
    <line>A single claw can shatter bone. And hope. Mostly hope.</line>
    <line>They molt their claws and come back with bigger ones. Evolution is cruel.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="coconut">
    <line>Yes, they really do eat coconuts. Rip 'em open like eggs. Makes me never want to snack again.</line>
    <line>Coconut obsession. I think it’s symbolic. Or they’re just insane.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="beach">
    <line>Beaches used to be peaceful. Now they’re ambush sites. Crabs own the sand.</line>
    <line>Step lightly on a beach at night. If it crunches, it's not a shell—it’s warning.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smell">
    <line>They reek of brine, rot, and something worse. Like spoiled ambition.</line>
    <line>I smell them before I see them. That’s how I survive now.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bite">
    <line>They bite. Why? Spite, probably.</line>
    <line>A crab bite isn't fatal. The infection afterward? That’s another matter.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>Crabs act strange under a full moon. Some say they worship it. I say they *report* to it.</line>
    <line>I watched one trace a circle in the sand. Perfect circle. Then it just... sat in the middle. Staring up.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Put a mirror near them, and they freeze. Maybe they don’t like what they see.</line>
    <line>Reflections confuse them. Or enrage them. Hard to tell with crabs.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>They hate ink. Once saw one avoid a spilled bottle like it was poison.</line>
    <line>I wrote a warning in squid ink. Found it shredded by dawn. Message received, I suppose.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lantern">
    <line>Lantern light draws them. Like moths. But if moths had claws and intent.</line>
    <line>Hang a lantern at night and watch. They come slow, clicking. Drawn to the glow like it owes them money.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dance">
    <line>They dance sometimes. In circles. With rhythm. I've mapped it. Might be a language.</line>
    <line>Saw three of them stomping in unison once. Ritual? Or just... weird exercise?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="storm">
    <line>Storms drive them inland. Something about pressure—they get restless.</line>
    <line>During a storm, I swear one spoke. Wind drowned it out, but the clicking had... syllables.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bones">
    <line>They don’t just scatter bones. They arrange them. Patterns. Shapes. Messages?</line>
    <line>Found a bone spiral once. Perfectly laid out. At the center? A crab, waiting.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fish">
    <line>They don’t eat fish. They use fish. Like tools. Or bait. Not sure which is worse.</line>
    <line>Watched one wear a dead fish like a helmet. I don’t ask questions anymore.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="jewels">
    <line>Crabs love shiny things. Jewels especially. Found one hoarding garnets in a clamshell.</line>
    <line>Gave one a ruby once. It stopped moving. Just held it. For hours.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="drum">
    <line>Sometimes at night, I hear drumming. Not music. Not human. Clicks on driftwood.</line>
    <line>Could be waves. Could be crabs. Could be waves made of crabs.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hat">
    <line>Wore a crab-shell hat once, for science. They followed me for miles.</line>
    <line>Never wear anything they recognize as ‘one of theirs’. That includes hats.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="laugh">
    <line>I swear one laughed once. Not a noise—just a body-shaking jitter. But it *felt* like laughter.</line>
    <line>If you hear one laugh, you’ve already lost. Or you’re insane. Or both.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="writing">
    <line>They scratch marks in driftwood. It’s not random. I think they’re *writing* something.</line>
    <line>Saw symbols on a crab’s shell once. Runes, maybe. Or very angry doodles.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nest">
    <line>They don’t build nests. They *grow* them. Out of trash and bones.</line>
    <line>Their nests pulse. I don’t know how else to describe it. Like breathing sand.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gift">
    <line>Left me a gift once—half a coconut, full of seaweed and teeth. Still don’t know what it meant.</line>
    <line>If a crab offers you something, don’t take it. Not because it’s dangerous—because it *means something*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>There’s a pattern to their movements. It’s not hunting. It’s... ritualistic.</line>
    <line>Found crabs arranged in a perfect triangle. One moved to complete it. I left. Fast.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="language">
    <line>They have a language. It’s not spoken. It’s *drummed* in clawbeats and tapping.</line>
    <line>I’ve begun to understand them. Just a few phrases. I wish I hadn’t.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="burrow">
    <line>Their burrows go *deep*. Too deep. One fell in and came out... different.</line>
    <line>You think you’re safe on land. You’re not. They dig. They wait.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>Don’t stare into their eyes. It’s not superstition—it’s survival.</line>
    <line>Crab eyes don’t blink. But they *judge*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hatchling">
    <line>Baby Coconut Crabs? Worse than adults. Fast, sneaky, swarm in dozens.</line>
    <line>One hatchling snuck in my pack. Ate my maps and pooped in my ink.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Fire scares them. Flash a torch, they back off. Unless they’re hungry.</line>
    <line>I once lit a beach on fire. Killed three. Worth it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boots">
    <line>Wear thick boots. Reinforced. Nothing fashionable—something that says 'I step on nightmares'.</line>

  <entry keyword="cold drake">

  <entry keyword="obsession">
    <line>I once studied them. Catalogued wing span, breath dispersion, ice crystal density. I was *fascinated*.</line>
    <line>My obsession blinded me. Thought I could get close, learn from them. One scream later—my daughter was gone.</line>
    <line>They say scholars should be dispassionate. Well, I'm passionately done with that nonsense.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ice">
    <line>Their ice burns. Not like fire—but slow, creeping, *final*. It doesn’t melt. It claims.</line>
    <line>Cold Drake breath freezes air mid-flight. Armor shatters like glass. Flesh cracks like bark in winter.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flight">
    <line>They fly low over snowfields to stir prey. Those wings churn storms like mixers in the sky.</line>

  <entry keyword="scale">
    <line>Their scales shimmer blue-white, like moonlight on frozen lakes. Stronger than steel. Harder to forget.</line>
    <line>I have a scale framed. Not out of pride. As a reminder: some beauty kills.</line>

    <line>Cold Drakes don’t just live in snow—they *shape* it. Their passing writes patterns only the mad can read.</line>

    <line>In the coldest places, you can’t feel your pulse. Sometimes, I wonder if they can take it from you.</line>

    <line>You hear a scream in the wind? That’s not a person. It’s the Cold Drake’s breath raking across air.</line>
    <line>The first time you hear it, it freezes your blood. The second time—it doesn’t matter.</line>

    <line>I speak to him still—through the soil. Perhaps he listens. Perhaps the Corpser does.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rootsong">
    <line>Some druids say Corpsers hum—a vibration through the roots. A 'rootsong.' I’ve heard it. It’s maddening.</line>
    <line>The earth quakes subtly when they rise. Listen closely—your bones will feel it before your ears do.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Fire works—but poorly. Damp roots don’t burn well. But it *hurts* them. They remember flame.</line>
    <line>A torch can drive them back. Not for long. Just long enough to run. Or strike true.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nest">
    <line>They nest in sunken groves. Hollow trees. Anyplace that smells like death and stillness.</line>
    <line>Corpser nests are quiet—too quiet. Even the insects know to stay away.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bones">
    <line>Their nests are lined with bones—mostly animal. Some, unmistakably human.</line>
    <line>They don’t clean kills. They decorate with them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lichen">
    <line>Corpser bark hosts lichen that glows faintly at night. Pretty, until it starts moving.</line>
    <line>Some say the lichen on their backs is symbiotic. I say it's camouflage for murder.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bog">
    <line>Bogs speak if you listen. They don't lie—but they also don't warn.</line>
    <line>You see a still bog, you run. You see it ripple without wind? Too late.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scream">
    <line>Corpsers don’t make a sound—but their victims do. That’s how you know one’s feeding.</line>
    <line>I once heard a scream rise through the soil. It echoed through my bones. Still does.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moss">
    <line>Moss grows thick where Corpsers linger. It muffles footfalls. And final words.</line>
    <line>I tried to track one through moss once. The trail ended in blood and silence.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sap">
    <line>Their sap isn’t sweet. It burns. Smells like copper and rot.</line>
    <line>I bottled Corpser sap once. Opened it days later. Still warm. Still pulsing.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eyes">
    <line>They have no eyes, but they *see* you. Through roots. Through soil. Through scent.</line>
    <line>Some say ancient Corpsers grow eyes—mossy orbs that blink with malice. I’ve seen one.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whispers">
    <line>The swamp whispers sometimes. Sounds like roots dragging secrets.</line>
    <line>I hear things when near their nests. Not words—memories. Not mine.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mud">
    <line>They coat themselves in mud when nesting. It keeps them cool. And hidden.</line>
    <line>Some Corpsers pull their prey under just for sport. The mud takes care of the rest.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="crown">
    <line>Atop the largest Corpsers, a crown of thorns. Symbolic? Decorative? Predatory.</line>
    <line>Their 'crown' is often just old bones and bark. Still… regal, in a monstrous way.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="circle">
    <line>Druids once formed circles around Corpser nests. To worship? To bind them? I don't know.</line>
    <line>The old rituals left rings in the soil. Corpsers bloom there still.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>Something made the first Corpser. Ritual gone wrong. Or perfectly right, depending on your view.</line>
    <line>I’ve found glyphs near their dens. Old language. No one should translate it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feast">
    <line>They don't eat. They absorb. Slow, patient feasts that stretch for days.</line>
    <line>If the swamp is quiet for too long, it means they're full.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ancestor">
    <line>Old folk say Corpsers come from those who refused to die. Roots took them instead.</line>
    <line>I met a sage who claimed Corpsers are our ancestors, returned to devour us. He laughed. Then cried.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pulse">
    <line>Stand near one long enough and you’ll feel it—*thump*… *thump*… the bog’s pulse.</line>
    <line>The ground pulses before they strike. Don’t mistake it for your heartbeat.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fruit">
    <line>Once, I saw a Corpser bearing fruit. Red as blood. Nothing that color should exist.</line>
    <line>Druids warn: never eat fruit from a Corpser. Unless you want to *grow* one inside you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tools">
    <line>Axes work better than swords. Chop, not slash. But really—you need fire.</line>
    <line>I once used a sickle laced with salt. Slowed it. Barely.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="symbiosis">
    <line>Some creatures live with Corpsers—slugs, beetles, even birds. How, I’ll never know.</line>
    <line>Symbiosis with a Corpser? That’s like friendship with a storm. It ends the same.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shrine">
    <line>Found a shrine to one once. Offerings of bone and bark. Who built it, I dare not guess.</line>
    <line>It’s not worship—it’s appeasement. Build a shrine, hope they sleep. Pray they forget you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="return">
    <line>Kill one, and another grows. Maybe the same one. Maybe worse.</line>
    <line>They don’t return. They *regrow*—stronger, thicker, deeper rooted.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spore">
    <line>They don't spread seeds. They release spores—heavy, damp, like breath you can't breathe.</line>
    <line>I inhaled a spore cloud once. Dreamed of roots growing through my ribs. Still dream it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="humus">
    <line>Their flesh is part humus, part horror. Touch one, and your hand comes away damp. And cold.</line>
    <line>They're born from mulch and madness. The bog itself gave birth to them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="relic">
    <line>I found a relic near one—an idol wrapped in vines. I believe it *summoned* them.</line>
    <line>Some say Corpsers were guardians once. Nature’s soldiers. But now? Now they obey only hunger.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rootbound">
    <line>To be rootbound is to be claimed by them—held in place, fed to the soil slowly.</line>
    <line>My brother is rootbound now. I dream of freeing him. One root at a time.</line>

  <entry keyword="cotton">
    <line>Ah, cotton—the whisper of the fields, the breath of looms. You appreciate it too?</line>
    <line>Cotton! A fabric so pure, it's like weaving sunlight. Have you ever touched raw fiber?</line>
    <line>To speak of cotton is to honor softness itself. But do you know how vital the fiber truly is?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fiber">
    <line>Fiber is the soul of all cloth! From thread to tapestry, it begins here. Ever worked a loom?</line>
    <line>Fiber binds the world—warp and weft. Speaking of weaving, are you familiar with the loom?</line>
    <line>Without strong fiber, even the grandest design falls apart. The loom is where stories come alive.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="loom">
    <line>The loom is my altar. Threads cross, destinies entwine. Have you studied thread tension?</line>
    <line>On the loom, time slows. Thread tension is everything—it’s the breath between fibers.</line>
    <line>I once adjusted thread tension mid-storm. It was glorious. You’ve adjusted tension before, yes?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tension">
    <line>Tension—subtle yet crucial. Too tight and the cloth snaps; too loose and it drifts. Ever tried carding?</line>
    <line>Tension teaches patience. True mastery begins with carding your own cotton.</line>
    <line>Ah, tension! Without it, nothing holds. But first, you must card the raw into form.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="carding">
    <line>Carding aligns the fibers, like preparing a choir to sing in harmony. But do you know about spinning?</line>
    <line>From tangled tufts to ordered strands—carding is divine. Spinning comes next, naturally.</line>
    <line>Carding clears the chaos. Then we spin it into purpose. Shall we speak of spinning?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spinning">
    <line>Spinning is magic—the birth of thread. But real strength lies in the weave.</line>
    <line>To spin is to give motion to stillness. But weaving gives it structure.</line>
    <line>I have spun cotton under moonlight. Still, the weaving is where the soul binds.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weaving">
    <line>Weaving—where rhythm meets design. Every pattern has a purpose. But what of dye?</line>
    <line>Weaving turns thread into story. But without dye, the tale is pale.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dye">
    <line>Dye gives life to cloth. But it’s the humble cotton that holds the hue best.</line>
    <line>With the right dye, cotton sings in colors unseen. But first, I need more of it—cotton, that is.</line>

  <entry keyword="fraying">
    <line>Fraying—the great undoing. Moths love it. Speaking of pests, have you ever met a silk snob?</line>
    <line>Fraying is a tragedy. Some say silk never frays, but I disagree. Silk snobs would argue, of course.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silk">
    <line>Silk may shimmer, but it lacks cotton’s soul. I once knew a merchant who sold only silk. Odd fellow.</line>
    <line>Silk is fine, but it’s too slippery for honest work. Cotton keeps its grip on reality.</line>

  <entry keyword="linen">
    <line>Linen breathes like a sleeping cat—soft, alive. But it lacks the warm heart of cotton.</line>
    <line>Linen wrinkles on purpose, like it’s too refined to care. Cotton, on the other hand, is humble.</line>

    <line>Robes are the highest expression of cloth. Flowing, ceremonial, dramatic. Like clouds with purpose.</line>
    <line>A robe can elevate a mortal to mystic. Or just hide a stain.</line>

  <entry keyword="purr">
    <line>A cougar’s purr isn’t comfort—it’s calculation. They're sizing you up.</line>

  </entry>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="stealth">
    <line>A cougar makes less noise than a falling leaf. Unless it wants you to hear it.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tracks">
    <line>Four toes. No claw marks. If you see ‘em, it’s already too late.</line>
    <line>Fresh tracks mean it’s close. Dry tracks mean it’s *watching*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="teeth">
    <line>Long, curved, clean. Nature’s daggers.</line>
    <line>If a cougar bites, pray it goes for the throat. Slower deaths are messier.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cloak">
    <line>This cloak? Cougar hide. Wore it once in cougar country. They charged faster. Took it as a challenge.</line>
    <line>Smells like musk and pride. The hide, I mean. Not me. Probably.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="prey">
    <line>Rabbits, deer, boars, travelers. They don’t discriminate.</line>
    <line>You think you’re not prey? So did the last knight I traveled with. Now he’s part of the soil.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>Cougars move with the moon. Full moon? They’re bolder. Hungrier.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boots">
    <line>Cougar claws shredded my boots once. Walked three miles barefoot in pride and pain.</line>
    <line>These boots? Reinforced with cougar hide. Still feel the scratch sometimes... ghost pain.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shade">
    <line>Cougars love the shade. Not for hiding—just because they know you can't see them there.</line>
    <line>If the trail goes cold, look where the sun doesn’t. That’s where they wait.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>Some say cougars sing at night. I say that’s not a song—it’s a scream dressed in fur.</line>
    <line>There’s a rhythm to their kills. I’ve heard it. Woke up humming it once. Scared myself.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>I dream in gold and blood. Guess that’s what years of cougar hunting does to you.</line>
    <line>Cougar eyes follow me into dreams. I stopped sleeping. Didn’t help.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whiskers">
    <line>A cougar’s whiskers feel vibrations. They know your heartbeat before you draw your blade.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bite">
    <line>They bite deep—not to kill, but to *hold* you. The death comes later.</line>
    <line>A cougar’s bite is quiet. Your scream won’t be.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scent">
    <line>They smell your sweat before you even see them. That’s why I bathe in ash.</line>
    <line>Cover your scent with sap and rot. Still won’t help much—but it makes ‘em hesitate.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mark">
    <line>They mark territory by clawing trees and peeing everywhere. Like noble beasts... with bladder issues.</line>
    <line>If it smells like cat and looks like hell, it’s cougar land. Tread carefully—or don’t tread at all.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mist">
    <line>They love the mist. It hides them, cools their fur, and makes every scream echo longer.</line>
    <line>Hunt in mist? You’re not hunting—you’re *offering.*</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rock">
    <line>Cougars perch on rocks to spot prey—or to look dramatic. Either way, don’t look up.</line>
    <line>Flat rocks, warm sun—that’s their throne. Approach like a fool, and you’ll meet the queen’s claws.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>Cougar blood is thick. Smells like metal and memory.</line>
    <line>The first time I spilled cougar blood... I wept. The second time, I laughed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silence">
    <line>You think silence is peaceful? That’s because you haven’t heard it right before a cougar lands on you.</line>
    <line>When the forest goes quiet, it’s not peace—it’s permission.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="knife">
    <line>I don’t use bows. Knives only. Up close. Personal. The cougar deserves that.</line>
    <line>Sharpen your knife twice as much when hunting cats. They make you work for every inch.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tailwind">
    <line>Cougars ride tailwinds. It carries their scent away and your fear toward them.</line>
    <line>If the wind shifts, so does your chance of survival.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pelt">
    <line>Their pelts are too perfect. Almost a shame to wear one. Almost.</line>
    <line>I wear it to honor them. And to warn the others.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gut">
    <line>Follow your gut when tracking cougars. Unless it’s growling—then eat first.</line>
    <line>My gut’s saved me more than my blade. But it’s also led me into three cougar dens.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="songbird">
    <line>They don’t eat songbirds. Too small. Too noisy. Just like me as a child.</line>
    <line>Once saw a cougar freeze just to listen to a bird sing. Then it moved—quiet as guilt.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="path">
    <line>Never take the same path twice in cougar territory. They remember.</line>
    <line>I mark my trail with thorns. If I bleed on the way back, I know I’m being followed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fur">
    <line>Smooth, golden, thick. Perfect insulation—and excellent camouflage.</line>
    <line>I sell the pelts sometimes. But I keep the claws. Trophies. Warnings.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="growl">
    <line>Low and short. Like thunder under your ribs.</line>
    <line>If you hear a cougar growl, it wants you to *know*. That’s the last kindness it offers.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ambush">
    <line>They don’t chase. They wait. When they move, it’s already over.</line>
    <line>You never see the first pounce. Only the blood after.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="butter">
    <line>They let us churn their milk into butter. *Why*? What are we playing into?</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>They never sleep. Just wait. Eyes open. Minds calculating.</line>
    <line>Heard a cow snore once. Woke up with hoofprints in a perfect spiral around my tent.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="horns">
    <line>Their horns aren’t for defense—they’re for channeling something. I’ve seen sparks.</line>
    <line>Horns conduct the will of the herd. You clip them, they scream… not in pain. In rage.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Cows cast the wrong shadows. I measured them at noon—they bent *east*.</line>
    <line>Their shadows move first. Like the body follows, not leads.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>They act strange under the full moon. Too still. Too... focused.</line>
    <line>Ever seen a cow *howl*? No? Then you're not watching close enough.</line>

    <line>They trample patterns into the ground. One time, it spelled a name. Mine.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hat">
    <line>They fear hats. Not sure why. Maybe it's respect. Maybe it’s ancestral trauma.</line>
    <line>Once wore a straw hat near them. One bowed. Another charged. Still confused.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mud">
    <line>They bathe in it. Soak. Commune. I think it's part of a rite.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fencepost">
    <line>Every seventh fencepost around cows leans left. Always left.</line>

    <line>Dig under their pastures—you'll find bone. Not just animal.</line>
  </entry>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="name">
    <line>They *have* names. They just don’t share them. Whispered, maybe… in the lowing.</line>

    <line>My ink turned to curdled milk when I wrote about them. Still used it. Still burned.</line>
    <line>Tried to draw a cow’s eye once. Paper caught fire. Slowly.</line>

    <line>Cows remember offenses. Especially small ones. Especially yours.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bones">
    <line>Found tiny bones inside a cow pie. Too clean. Too... humanoid.</line>

    <line>When the wind moos, leave. That’s not weather—that’s warning.</line>

  <entry keyword="book">
    <line>There are no cow books in the libraries. Ask why. Ask twice. Then stop asking.</line>

  <entry keyword="tail">
    <line>Their tails are antennae. Wagging out transmissions.</line>
    <line>A cow’s tail twitches in code. Morse? Maybe. Darker? Likely.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chew">
    <line>They chew endlessly. That’s not digestion—it’s meditation.</line>
    <line>Each chew is a calculation. You interrupt them, you throw off the entire rhythm.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>Put a mirror in the sea once. It came back with teeth marks.</line>

    <line>I wrote a paper on dolphin cognition. They destroyed every copy.</line>
    <line>Ink dissolves in salt water. So does truth, apparently.</line>

  <entry keyword="gift">
    <line>They bring gifts sometimes. Dead fish, broken shells, bits of boat.</line>
    <line>If a dolphin brings you a gift, check what’s missing afterward.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wake">
    <line>Their wake trails ripple like warnings. Or threats written in water.</line>
    <line>You see a wake and no ship? That’s your cue to *run*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>Their songs aren’t songs. They’re signals. Some still play in my nightmares.</line>
    <line>A bard once tried to transcribe their melody. He doesn’t speak anymore.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="map">
    <line>They swim along ley lines. Not by accident. They *know*.</line>
    <line>Found my sunken chart inside a dolphin nest. Annotated.</line>

  <entry keyword="tooth">
    <line>Kept a dolphin tooth once. Gave me dreams. Gave it back.</line>
    <line>A single tooth, serrated just enough to whisper purpose.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>I once saw them circle in perfect patterns. Not hunting. Not feeding. *Chanting*.</line>
    <line>The sea’s not sacred. But they make it feel that way. Terribly sacred.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flipper">
    <line>Don’t say that name. That one started it all.</line>
    <line>‘Flipper’ was real. And a war criminal.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shiny">
    <line>They love shiny things. Coins. Blades. Eyeballs.</line>
    <line>Drop a gem in the sea—it won’t hit bottom. It’ll hit a dolphin hoard first.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whistle">
    <line>Their whistles match human speech patterns. Sometimes… too well.</line>
    <line>I once heard my own name whistled from the waves. I hadn’t spoken it aloud in weeks.</line>

    <line>They don’t just see you. They *memorize* you. Every move, every tremble.</line>

    <line>They stand on one leg for hours—not resting, *thinking*. Planning.</line>
    <line>They feed in the mist. Always the mist. Something about it suits their cruelty.</line>
    <line>Cranes travel in silence. Even the wind respects them.</line>

  <entry keyword="revenge">
    <line>One pecked out my uncle’s eye for stepping too close to its nest. He never stepped again.</line>
    <line>They took my orchard. They didn’t eat the fruit. They just *trampled* it. That’s malice, not hunger.</line>

  <entry keyword="lake">
    <line>They love lakes. Still water hides sharp talons.</line>
    <line>I named that place Weeping Lake after what I saw them do. No one else goes there anymore.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="beak">
    <line>Sharp as guilt, fast as rumor. A crane's beak is more blade than bone.</line>
    <line>The beak is how they judge you. One strike for truth, two for lies.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dance">
    <line>You think it's a mating dance. It's not. It’s a warning. A threat. A ritual before they strike.</line>
    <line>I once mistook their dance for joy. Then they cut down my dog mid-step.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grace">
    <line>They move like poetry—war poems, sharp and unkind.</line>
    <line>Grace is just efficiency in cruelty. The cranes perfected it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wing">
    <line>Their wings span shadows across fields. Shadows wide enough to forget the sun.</line>
    <line>Wings like banners of an old god—majestic, terrifying, forgotten only by fools.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>They have no kindness in their gaze. Only the promise of silence.</line>
    <line>Look into a crane’s eye and you’ll forget what mercy feels like.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fruit">
    <line>They don’t eat the fruit. They step on it. Ruin it. Why? Ask the gods. Or the devils.</line>
    <line>My orchard was full of life—until they came. Now it’s just footprints and pulp.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mist">
    <line>Where there's mist, there's cranes. They rise from it like regrets at dawn.</line>
    <line>Cranes are born of mist and malice. I swear it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sound">
    <line>They make no sound unless they *want* to. When you hear them, you’re already too late.</line>
    <line>One screech from a crane will haunt your sleep. Two will end it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="statue">
    <line>Sometimes they stand so still, villagers carve around them. The statues leave when no one looks.</line>
    <line>I built a statue to warn others. The crane stood next to it. Mocked me with stillness.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flight">
    <line>Their flight is beautiful—like watching vengeance on wings.</line>
    <line>They don’t flee. They *ascend*. That’s the difference.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="book">
    <line>I wrote a book on cranes. Burned it after I saw one reading over my shoulder.</line>
    <line>Books won’t save you from cranes. But they’ll teach you how to hate properly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Cranes cast long shadows. Longer than seems natural. I've measured them. They stretch with intent.</line>
    <line>Step into a crane's shadow and you’ll feel it: that weight on your chest. That’s not fear. That’s memory.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clock">
    <line>I built a sundial to track them. They moved in ways the light couldn’t explain.</line>
    <line>They arrived at dawn, always. But never from the same direction. It’s as if they *rewrite* the sky.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>I dream of feathers falling like snow, each one whispering secrets I’ve never told.</line>
    <line>When I sleep, they come to me—not as birds, but as watchers. Cold eyes. Judgment in silence.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>I caught one watching itself in a mirror once. It wept. Or maybe laughed. Hard to say with beaks.</line>
    <line>I don’t keep mirrors anymore. Cranes don’t have reflections. They just *borrow* yours.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trap">
    <line>I set snares, nets, spikes—none of it works. They see through traps like they see through lies.</line>
    <line>Once, I built a mechanical decoy. They surrounded it. Then tore it apart with surgical calm.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boots">
    <line>My boots are made of crane-hide. Or so the tanner claimed. They whisper when I walk. I don’t like it.</line>
    <line>I burned my old boots after stepping in a crane nest. Nothing stuck—just the smell of regret.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>Cranes don’t fight the wind. They glide through it. Almost like they *command* it.</line>
    <line>When the wind goes still but the trees still sway, a crane is nearby. Watching. Deciding.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="plumage">
    <line>Their plumage is seasonal, but not with weather. It changes with intent.</line>
    <line>White in spring, gray in sorrow, red in rage. The colors lie as much as they warn.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="child">
    <line>My child once fed a crane. It bowed. She smiled. Then it followed her for weeks.</line>
    <line>Children see cranes differently. They smile back. That’s the first mistake.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="noise">
    <line>They hate sudden noise. Once smashed a flute over its own beak in protest.</line>
    <line>A bard once tried to charm one. He made it to the second verse. The beak reached him first.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tail">
    <line>Do cranes have tails? No one agrees. I say yes—but only when they run.</line>
    <line>A flash of tail-feathers is a sign of intent. If you see them, it's already too late.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bones">
    <line>Found a pile of bones arranged like a bird in flight. No footprints. Just feathers.</line>
    <line>Their bones are hollow but heavy. Like guilt, I suppose.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scratch">
    <line>I’ve found markings carved into bark, talon-deep. Patterns too precise for nature.</line>
    <line>They leave scratches, but not randomly. They're *writing*. And no one wants to translate it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>I tried to paint one. The brush shattered when I touched the canvas.</line>
    <line>Black ink doesn't capture cranes. You need blood. Preferably your own. Just a drop.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gait">
    <line>Measured, deliberate. Like a nobleman judging your shoes.</line>
    <line>A crane's walk is not movement—it's ceremony.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scent">
    <line>They don’t smell like birds. They smell like cold iron and thunder about to break.</line>
    <line>I tried to mask my scent once. Didn’t matter. They already knew me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="beard">
    <line>I saw an old man with a beard just like a crane’s neck—long, white, accusatory.</line>
    <line>When I asked if he’d seen them, he only said: 'They *let* you see them.'</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sky">
    <line>Look up too long and you’ll miss them. Because they’re already behind you.</line>
    <line>The sky is their kingdom, but the ground is their court. We are the trial.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="path">
    <line>Never follow a path after a crane. They don’t walk straight—they walk *true*.</line>
    <line>They don’t wander. Every step is a message to someone who isn’t you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="coin">
    <line>I tossed a coin to distract one. It caught it mid-air. Stared at me. Then vanished.</line>
    <line>They don’t want wealth. They want *meaning*. Coins are just shiny lies.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>Cranes don’t need to drink blood. But I’ve seen them do it. Slowly. Deliberately.</line>
    <line>Their beaks are always clean after the kill. Not a drop. That’s what haunts me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nest">
    <line>Their nests are made of bones and reeds. The reeds are for structure. The bones are for memory.</line>
    <line>Find a crane’s nest, and you’ll find every mistake you’ve ever made.</line>

    <line>I study dragons. Specifically, the Crimson Drake—the jewel-scaled nightmare of the skies.</line>
    <line>Once a scholar. Now? A dragon-hater with too much knowledge and not enough fireproof clothing.</line>
    <line>My life’s work was admiration. Then came the fire. Now it’s vengeance... and publication.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="crimson">
    <line>Crimson Drakes—the most beautiful horror you'll ever see.</line>
    <line>Red as a dying sun. Scales like rubies, breath like a furnace. Let me tell you more, if you've the nerve.</line>
    <line>One crimson ruined my life. Now I ruin theirs—in research, and in battle.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="drake">
    <line>Not quite dragons, but nearly as deadly. Arrogant creatures. Fast. Smart. Vicious.</line>
    <line>Crimson Drakes don’t just burn forests—they *choose* targets. That’s what haunts me most.</line>
    <line>Some call them lesser dragons. Those people are now ashes, and wrong.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Their breath isn't just heat. It *clings*—like living napalm. Burned half my regiment that way.</line>
    <line>The fire isn’t what kills—it’s the way it lingers. Long after the drake is gone, your world still smolders.</line>
    <line>I've watched a village vanish in seconds. Screams replaced by cinders.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hate">
    <line>Hate? No. Hate is too simple. I *understand* them. And that’s worse.</line>
    <line>I hate them because I once loved them. Because I let one live—and it took everything.</line>
    <line>My family died admiring one from afar. I don’t make that mistake anymore.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>They roost in volcanic craters, obsidian caves, and old ruins thick with heat and echoes.</line>
    <line>They hunt during dawn and dusk—twilight predators. Harder to spot. Harder to survive.</line>
    <line>They collect shiny things, but not for greed—for memory. Every treasure marks a death.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scale">
    <line>Each scale reflects light like a gem. That’s how they lure the curious. Like my son...</line>
    <line>I’ve tried to pierce their scales. Most steel shatters. Dragonbone-tipped bolts work—sometimes.</line>
    <line>You’ll know one’s near when light dances off nothing. That shimmer? It’s watching.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="revenge">
    <line>Revenge keeps my heart beating—and my hands steady when I carve through drakehide.</line>
    <line>They took everything. I’ve studied every heartbeat, every flight pattern. Now it’s my turn.</line>
    <line>Revenge is my thesis. And the Crimson Drake is my final subject.</line>

  <entry keyword="obsidian">
    <line>They nest in obsidian—dark, sharp, heat-soaked. Like they *belong* in nightmares.</line>
    <line>Obsidian caves amplify their roars. Once shook a fortress wall to rubble.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wing">
    <line>Crimson wings span twenty feet—thin enough to glow, strong enough to send a man flying.</line>
    <line>Their wings don’t flap when they’re hunting. They *glide*—silent and final.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flame">
    <line>They breathe fire, yes—but some say they *shape* it. Burn in arcs, in whips. Controlled destruction.</line>
    <line>The flames aren’t natural. They *linger*. Some say magical. I say cursed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gold">
    <line>Crimson Drakes hoard gold, but not for wealth. For warmth. It retains heat. Clever monsters.</line>
    <line>Find gold flecked with soot and claw marks, you’re near a roost. Or a funeral.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>Their eyes glow—not from within, but from rage. That’s not metaphor. That’s fact.</line>
    <line>One eye locked on me across the field. I still see it when I close mine.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scholar">
    <line>I was once respected. Now they call me mad. Let them. I know more than any of them.</line>
    <line>Books burn. Memories scar. But I write with fire now.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="loss">
    <line>My wife. My son. My research. All lost in one scream of flame. So yes, I’m bitter.</line>
    <line>You don’t understand loss until you watch someone you love admire their killer.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="embers">
    <line>Embers are the drake’s footprint. They don’t walk away—they *linger* in the air, defying wind.</line>
    <line>Sometimes I follow ember trails for miles. Once, they led me into a lair. I still have the burns.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="screech">
    <line>Not all drakes roar. Some screech—high, sharp, like steel screaming. It’s the last sound many hear.</line>
    <line>A screech can crack glass. Or hearts. I’ve seen veterans flinch at the memory.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ruins">
    <line>They favor ancient ruins. Not for shelter—for *arrogance*. Like they deserve our forgotten glories.</line>
    <line>Crumbling temples, burnt towers—wherever history stands, drakes try to end it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="molten">
    <line>They bleed molten gold, or so the legends say. I’ve only seen the glow—it’s enough.</line>
    <line>Touch molten drake blood? You’ll never feel cold again. Or sanity.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rune">
    <line>Found ancient runes near a burnt circle. Something drake-like, but... older. Wiser. Hungrier.</line>
    <line>Some say the runes call to them. Others say they were written *by* them. I say both are doomed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="talon">
    <line>I’ve found talon marks on stone. Carved like a chisel, like they were writing… or warning.</line>
    <line>A drake’s talon is sharper than steel. Some say it can pierce a soul. I believe it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sky">
    <line>When the sky turns red at dawn, that’s not weather. That’s prophecy. Or worse, migration.</line>
    <line>Look up too long in drake territory and you’ll see shapes that *aren’t clouds*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>Their roars echo for miles. But sometimes... the echo comes first.</line>
    <line>Heard an echo once that never ended. Just kept bouncing through the valley. Still does.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="claw">
    <line>I keep a claw on my desk. Bigger than a man’s hand. It pulses on stormy nights.</line>
    <line>Claws can carve armor like parchment. But they also write. Ever seen claw-script? I have.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flute">
    <line>I tried to mimic their calls once—on a flute. Woke something in the hills. It didn’t fly. It *crawled*.</line>
    <line>The flute was made from bone. Not human. Not animal. Something else.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="breath">
    <line>Their breath isn’t just fire. It’s hunger. A spell. A memory turned weapon.</line>
    <line>I once inhaled a lungful of drake breath. Couldn’t dream for a week. Just heat. And teeth.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Their shadow comes minutes before their scream. But if it’s *silent*... it’s already too late.</line>
    <line>A drake’s shadow once passed over me. My hair went white. Just a streak. Never grew back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="map">
    <line>I chart drake sightings. The map looks like blood spatter. But maybe that’s just my ink.</line>
    <line>One old map marked a region as 'Here Be Warmth'. A joke? Or the last note of a burning hand?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scale pattern">
    <line>Each drake has a different scale pattern. Like a fingerprint. Or a sigil. Or a warning label.</line>
    <line>Scholars say scale patterns tell lineage. I think they tell *intent*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="egg">
    <line>A Crimson Drake egg glows faintly. Like a heartbeat. Some say it’s the mother calling back.</line>
    <line>Steal a drake egg, you earn a death with wings. One thief lasted three days. They found only smoke.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="voice">
    <line>Some claim drakes can mimic voices. I once heard my brother’s voice in the flames. He’s been dead ten years.</line>
    <line>The drake’s voice isn’t words. It’s memory—*your* memory, played back in fire.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tail">
    <line>Their tail can smash a wall. But it’s not for battle—it’s for balance. The grace of a dancer. The fury of a storm.</line>
    <line>I saw one slice a tree in half with a twitch. Imagine what it does to flesh.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pulse">
    <line>Before they strike, the air pulses. A heartbeat you don’t hear, but *feel* in your bones.</line>
    <line>Some call it a magical aura. I call it dread.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="soul">
    <line>A Crimson Drake doesn’t just kill. It marks your soul. I’ve *seen* the scars.</line>
    <line>You can burn a body. But what they do? That’s deeper. That’s *inside*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ash">
    <line>Ash is what remains. Of my home. Of my hopes. Of the weak.</line>
    <line>I keep a jar of ash from the first village they destroyed. A reminder. And a promise.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="legend">
    <line>Some say Crimson Drakes are the children of an ancient fire god. I say they’re worse—*real*.</line>
    <line>Legends flatter them. Reality is sharper, hotter, and always watching.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tooth">
    <line>I wear a drake tooth around my neck. Not for luck. For proof.</line>
    <line>Their teeth grow back. Slowly. But that first one? It stays with me.</line>

  <entry keyword="daemon">
    <line>Not born of hell nor summoned from the void. They *grow*, like tumors in mana-rich caverns.</line>

    <line>Each daemon I study, I lose a piece of myself. Yet I must know more.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gem">
    <line>They feed on the arcane currents in gems. Sapphires. Topaz. Especially soulstones.</line>
    <line>I was a gemcutter once. Then a crystal daemon shattered my shop and my life.</line>
    <line>Gems sing to them. A resonance only they hear. Or… perhaps *feel*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hum">
    <line>You’ll hear them before you see them — a resonance that tickles the blood.</line>
    <line>Their hum isn’t sound. It’s pressure. A psychic static that crushes thought.</line>
    <line>Once I listened too long. I still dream in fractured chords and crystal screams.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rage">
    <line>They do not kill for hunger. They kill for silence. For peace. Their kind sees *us* as the noise.</line>
    <line>When their calm is broken, their rage is immaculate. A storm in a prism.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen a daemon go from stillness to slaughter in a heartbeat of a hum.</line>

  <entry keyword="vengeance">
    <line>My apprentice touched a shard — a mere sliver — and dissolved into light. I will not rest.</line>

    <line>A bard once played a chord so pure it stunned one. Then it shattered him with a single shriek.</line>
    <line>They respond to music — not like beasts, but like critics. Very violent critics.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cut">
    <line>Cutting a crystal daemon is like slicing glass full of lightning. It bleeds light. And rage.</line>
    <line>Don’t try to cut one. Shatter it. Or burn it. Or both.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="light">
    <line>They don’t cast shadows. They *eat* them.</line>
    <line>Bright light annoys them. Pure darkness enrages them. Balance is key.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="arcane">
    <line>They absorb magic like a sponge in a storm. Spellcasters beware.</line>
    <line>A mage once tried to trap one in a circle. The circle melted. So did the mage.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="madness">
    <line>Too much study makes the mind splinter. Mine’s already cracked, so I’m safe.</line>
    <line>To understand them is to lose something of yourself. To kill them? You reclaim it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pulse">
    <line>Their bodies pulse in time with leylines. Like they’re syncing with the world’s heartbeat.</line>
    <line>I saw one pulse in sync with a wounded unicorn. It *stole* its rhythm. And then its life.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="collection">
    <line>I collect their fragments. Each hums differently. Like voices trapped inside.</line>
    <line>My shelves sing at night. I don’t mind anymore. It means they remember I survived.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glow">
    <line>They glow in frequencies the eye barely sees. But the soul notices.</line>
    <line>The glow is not light—it's intention. Like they’re announcing judgment.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>Their movements echo oddly—like sound bouncing through memories, not space.</line>
    <line>I once followed an echo for an hour. It ended with a scream that wasn’t mine.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>Their blood is light, refracted wrong. It stains the soul more than the stone.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen their blood carve runes into the ground as it fell. Never figured out why.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="touch">
    <line>Touching one is like holding lightning and sorrow. I don’t recommend it.</line>
    <line>I brushed a shard once. My hand’s been numb and insightful ever since.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>They visit in dreams. Not like visitors. Like landlords.</line>
    <line>Last night, I dreamed in crystal. No sound. Just light pulsing like thought.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="name">
    <line>They have names. Not spoken ones—*vibrations*. Each one a song you’ll regret hearing.</line>
    <line>To name one is to bind a thought around madness. That’s why I don’t try anymore.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="symmetry">
    <line>Their symmetry is unnatural. Too perfect. So perfect it makes the world seem crooked.</line>
    <line>Symmetry draws them. Maybe it reminds them of home—wherever *that* is.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mimic">
    <line>Some say they mimic voices. I say they *reconstruct* them. Better than the original.</line>
    <line>I once heard my dead mentor’s voice echo from a cave. I didn’t go in. I still regret that.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dust">
    <line>Their dust lingers in lungs and minds. You’ll feel it long after they’re gone.</line>
    <line>Sweep their dust under your rug and it hums at night. Don’t ask how I know.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lightning">
    <line>Lightning bends near them. Like it recognizes a sibling it hates.</line>
    <line>One struck during a storm—became translucent, then vanished. Maybe ascended. Maybe disintegrated.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="language">
    <line>They don’t speak. But if you listen to the vibrations long enough, you start *thinking* in their rhythm.</line>
    <line>I once translated a shard’s pulse into syllables. It said 'endure'. I wish it hadn’t.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="reflection">
    <line>Don’t look at them through water. They move differently in reflections.</line>
    <line>I caught one staring into a pond. When I looked, *I* was the one reflected in its eyes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pain">
    <line>They don’t seem to feel pain. Or maybe they *do*, and that’s why they scream so beautifully.</line>
    <line>Inflict pain on one, and the world around it bends slightly. Like reality's cringing.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>Sometimes their shards whisper. Not words. More like intentions brushing against your will.</line>
    <line>I stored one in a velvet box. It kept whispering until the box melted.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="color">
    <line>Each one gleams a color you’ve never seen before—and won’t forget once you do.</line>
    <line>They wear color like armor. Or warning. Or invitation. Hard to tell.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="circle">
    <line>They hate closed circles. Break them. Interrupt them. Or escape them.</line>
    <line>A perfect circle draws their attention. A broken one repels them. I mark my camps accordingly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>They have no eyes, but they *see*. Not with sight—through analysis, like prisms inspecting you.</line>
    <line>I stared into its face and felt… measured. And found lacking.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chant">
    <line>One day I heard monks chanting near the ruins. The daemons sang back. Only the crystals remember how it ended.</line>
    <line>There’s a chant that makes them pause. Just a heartbeat. But sometimes that’s all you need.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="truth">
    <line>They seek something. A pattern. A truth only they understand. Or maybe they *are* the truth.</line>
    <line>I once believed they held the truth. Then I survived one encounter. Now I believe in lies.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bones">
    <line>Crystal grows over bones if left too long near a daemon’s nest. I’ve seen skulls blooming like geodes.</line>
    <line>I found a ribcage with crystal veins once. Still warm. Still humming.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="void">
    <line>They aren’t from the Void. They *reject* it. They’re the silence between stars, not the darkness beyond them.</line>
    <line>The Void fears them. That should terrify *you*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fragile">
    <line>They break beautifully. But what they become afterward? That’s worse.</line>
    <line>A shattered daemon is still alive. Just... angrier. More focused.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="field">
    <line>Stand too close and you’ll feel it—a field of tension, like the world resisting them.</line>
    <line>Birds avoid the space around them. Even the wind walks gently past.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gift">
    <line>One left a crystal on my doorstep. No note. Just a low, humming apology.</line>
    <line>The gift it left pulsed once when I touched it. Haven’t slept since.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glitter">
    <line>Their glitter isn’t dust. It’s *shrapnel*. One breath in and you’ll cough blood and stars.</line>
    <line>I still find glitter in my wounds from the last one. It itches. With *intent*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fragile">
    <line>They look fragile. Like you could snap one in half. But their form is deceptive. And fatal.</line>
    <line>A broken crystal daemon is more dangerous than a whole one. Ask the ruins of Drayholm.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="focus">
    <line>Don’t blink. They move faster when you look away. But they *see* through your focus.</line>
    <line>Focus your mind before a fight. They love scattered thoughts. Easier to crack open.</line>
  </entry>

<trait name="Crystal Hydra Scholar" priority="40">
  <entry keyword="hydra">
    <line>Ah, the Crystal Hydra... a prism of wrath, a marvel of living gemstone. And my eternal bane.</line>
    <line>They are as deadly as they are magnificent—each head a facet of malice.</line>
    <line>Speak the word 'hydra' in reverence... and caution. Their beauty hides brutal intent.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="crystal">
    <line>Their bodies are not mere stone, but enchanted lattice—harder than steel, more beautiful than diamonds.</line>
    <line>Crystals grow where they sleep. You’ll find their dens glittering... and slick with blood.</line>
    <line>Crystalline growths shimmer with magic—touch one, and you may lose a finger or your mind.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hatred">
    <line>They killed my mentor. Reduced him to glass shards with a breath of fractal fire.</line>
    <line>You don’t *study* these creatures and walk away unchanged. Some lose their lives. Others, their peace.</line>
    <line>I hate them not for what they are—but what they *could* be, if ever tamed. Or worse—understood.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="breath">
    <line>Their breath is not fire—it’s light. Refracted, radiant, and lethal. Burns the soul as well as the skin.</line>
    <line>One inhalation—like standing inside a shattered rainbow made of heat and hate.</line>
    <line>They exhale prisms. Each one a weapon of condensed fury. You’ll know it when you see it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lair">
    <line>Their lairs are cathedrals of splintered glass. Echoing halls of death and brilliance.</line>
    <line>I ventured into a den once. Came back blind in one eye and wiser in both.</line>
    <line>If you hear singing in the stone... turn back. That’s not a voice. That’s resonance.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="slay" itemType="KillQuestScroll" ctorArgs="CrystalHydra,5,10000">
    <line>If you truly wish to understand them—kill five. Dissect the danger. Earn the truth.</line>
    <line>I've charted every known migration. You want to help? Cleanse five dens. Take this scroll.</line>
    <line>Beauty without limits becomes horror. You’ll see—bring me five Crystal Hydra corpses.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Flavor and Red Herring Keywords -->

  <entry keyword="mentor">
    <line>His name was Alvinar. He believed the hydras could be reasoned with. Now he's part of their cave wall.</line>
    <line>He taught me wonder... and the cost of misjudging it. His bones still glimmer in their lair.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="reflection">
    <line>Never look a Crystal Hydra in the eye. You’ll see yourself—dying—infinitely.</line>
    <line>Reflections twist in their hide. Some say it shows futures. Others say it drives you mad. Both are right.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>They hum. Not music—vibration. The resonance of pure mana. It *hurts*.</line>
    <line>The song of a hydra is not heard. It's *felt*, in your teeth and your fear.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scale">
    <line>Their scales shimmer with ancient enchantments. Even dead, they pulse with magic.</line>
    <line>I keep one in a lead box. It sings at night. I haven’t slept in weeks.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="light">
    <line>They don’t *emit* light—they *bleed* it. Unnatural. Wrong. Beautiful.</line>
    <line>Their glow draws moths, fools, and scholars. I was all three once.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="madness">
    <line>Studying them too long twists the mind. I’ve seen archivists claw their own eyes out.</line>
    <line>Obsession is a side effect. Or perhaps the cause. Hard to say anymore.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>A mirror won’t save you. It just doubles your terror.</line>
    <line>Their breath reflects off polished surfaces. Bad news if you're wearing armor.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="color">
    <line>Each hydra head glows a different hue—violet for rage, blue for hunger, green for memory. Or so I theorize.</line>
    <line>Color isn’t cosmetic. It's emotional. When the heads align into white light... run.</line>
    <line>I saw one flash crimson once. Still don’t know what that meant, but my guide exploded.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dust">
    <line>Hydras leave behind glittering dust—mana-laced residue. Harmless… mostly.</line>
    <line>Don’t inhale the dust. It clings to the lungs and whispers dreams of burning stars.</line>
    <line>I kept some in a jar once. It turned to liquid under moonlight.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glass">
    <line>Their breath fuses sand into mirrors. Whole beaches turned to glass sheets.</line>
    <line>A hydra’s den has no stone—only jagged panes. One wrong step and you're a memory.</line>
    <line>Some say they were born from broken stained glass in the cathedrals of fallen gods.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="venom">
    <line>They don’t use venom, per se. But the refracted light *feels* like it’s poisoning your thoughts.</line>
    <line>Venom? No. Their poison is philosophical: awe, confusion, and eventual madness.</line>
    <line>You won’t swell or rot—you’ll simply *change*. That’s worse, I think.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="heartbeat">
    <line>I heard its heartbeat once. Rhythmic. Geometric. Like a ticking prism in the dark.</line>
    <line>You’ll know you're too close when you feel your own pulse answering theirs.</line>
    <line>Their hearts don’t beat—they *resonate*. That’s why the walls hum.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>They cast no shadow. Or cast too many. It depends on the moon. And your state of mind.</line>
    <line>I saw a hydra’s shadow detach once. It moved independently. Still not sure if I imagined that.</line>
    <line>Sometimes, you only see them *as* shadows—blinding light behind a silhouette of death.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="library">
    <line>The Hall of Silent Tomes bans all mention of Crystal Hydras. Too many vanished librarians.</line>
    <line>We once tried to write a treatise. The pages turned transparent. The ink screamed.</line>
    <line>A single scale in the Grand Library erased six scrolls and a translator’s memory.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dreams">
    <line>They enter dreams. Or perhaps dreams enter them. Either way, sleep carefully.</line>
    <line>I dreamed of a hydra once. Woke up with a shard in my hand and no wounds.</line>
    <line>Dreams are their testing ground. If you survive there, *maybe* you can face one awake.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>They have no eyes, yet they see. Light reflects off everything—we’re all mirrors to them.</line>
    <line>One scholar insisted the hydra’s 'eyes' were actually seeing backward in time. He’s quiet now.</line>
    <line>To look at them is to be looked *through*. Peered into. Measured. Judged.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pulse">
    <line>The cave walls *pulse* when they’re near. Like breathing stone. Or waiting teeth.</line>
    <line>I measured the frequency of a hydra’s pulse. Matched it to a forgotten lullaby. Disturbing.</line>
    <line>You’ll feel it first in your fingertips—a thrumming, like you’re touching prophecy.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>There are ancient rites to summon or banish them. Most involve mirrors. And sacrifice.</line>
    <line>One cult tried a ritual. The hydra came—then fractured the altar and the priest into matching sets.</line>
    <line>No ritual *contains* a Crystal Hydra. At best, you buy time. At worst, it *joins in*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rain">
    <line>Rain glitters oddly near their dens—refracted midair. Like falling knives of light.</line>
    <line>A storm once swept through a hydra valley. The lightning... it bent around them.</line>
    <line>I saw crystal rain. It sliced trees clean in half. The hydras just drank it in.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>They don’t speak—but the light *whispers*. Some swear it offers bargains. Lies, more likely.</line>
    <line>Whispers in the dark? Could be echo. Could be memory. Could be a hydra learning your name.</line>
    <line>Don’t follow the whisper. It's not yours. And it never ends where you think.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>Hydra caves echo before you make a sound. Like they remember footsteps.</line>
    <line>Sometimes the echoes ask questions. Never answer. It’s listening.</line>
    <line>A hydra’s lair doesn’t echo *you*—it echoes everything you fear.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="birth">
    <line>No one’s seen a young Crystal Hydra. Maybe they hatch full-grown. Or emerge from fractured light.</line>
    <line>One theory says they form in thunderclaps—light trapped in stone. Unproven. Terrifying.</line>
    <line>I found an egg once. Smooth. Transparent. It cracked itself—then vanished.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mood">
    <line>The hue of their glow shifts with mood. Rage burns red. Contempt... violet, I think.</line>
    <line>They have moods like weather—sudden, vast, and uncaring.</line>
    <line>You can’t read them. You can only *hope* you’re beneath their notice.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sing">
    <line>No vocal cords. Yet somehow, their lairs *sing*. A choir of shifting resonance.</line>
    <line>They hum in patterns. I mapped one once. It spelled a word. I’ve never repeated it.</line>
    <line>The singing isn’t beautiful. It’s correct. In a way that breaks you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gem">
    <line>They collect gemstones—not as hoard, but as sustenance. Mana crystallized. Devoured.</line>
    <line>A rare ruby once led me to a den. I left the ruby. And three fingers.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tail">
    <line>The tail’s tipped with a shard spike. One hit can skewer steel and hope.</line>
    <line>Avoid the tail. That’s not advice—it’s survival.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grudge">
    <line>Hydras don’t forget. Wound one, and it *will* remember. Some say they dream of vengeance.</line>
    <line>I once wounded one. Years later, it found my camp. I wasn’t even there—and it *still* burned everything.</line>
  </entry>

<trait name="Crystal Scholar" priority="40">
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>I study crystalline entities—particularly the Lattice Seekers. Beauty shaped by hunger.</line>
    <line>Once I was a scholar of magical mineralogies. Now? I'm a hunter with unfinished work.</line>
    <line>My job? It was discovery. Until the day discovery bit back. Now I study how they *die*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="crystal">
    <line>Their lattice structures are near-perfect. Angular, geometric elegance... masking horror.</line>
    <line>Crystals grow across their limbs like armor—and like lures. Fascinating. And fatal.</line>
    <line>Don’t touch wild crystal clusters. Sometimes they aren’t clusters. Sometimes they’re watching.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lattice">
    <line>The lattice is how they communicate. Vibrations through quartz—messages in music only they understand.</line>
    <line>Each lattice is unique. Like a fingerprint. Or a curse.</line>
    <line>My mentor once said the lattice sings. That was the last thing he ever said.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="seeker">
    <line>Seekers don’t just *wander*. They *hunt* for magic. Mana, power, enchanted trinkets—you name it.</line>
    <line>They absorbed an entire library once. Not the books—the enchantments holding it up.</line>
    <line>Seekers will drain your wand, your ring, your staff—then your bones, for good measure.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hate">
    <line>Hate? Yes. I *loved* them once. Until they reduced my lab—and my apprentice—to glimmering dust.</line>
    <line>They took my life's work. Left behind only silence and fractured stone.</line>
    <line>I don’t hate many things. But I hate them with all the precision of a scalpel and all the fury of a quake.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>They migrate toward magical pressure—battlefields, rituals, wizard towers. Mana draws them like moths.</line>
    <line>They’re mostly dormant during the day. Night? They hum. Like an orchestra tuning for blood.</line>
    <line>You’ll know they’re near when your scrolls curl and your gems flicker. That’s when you run—or kill.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weakness">
    <line>Vibration disrupts them. Hit them with sonic bursts—or shatter spells. Cracks their cohesion.</line>
    <line>Fire won’t work. Too pure. You need chaos. Magic with entropy. Let the spell unravel them.</line>
    <line>They hate dissonance—broken rhythms. Makes them falter. Use noise, not just blades.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="revenge">
    <line>I won’t rest until ten of them lie shattered beneath my feet. Maybe then I’ll sleep again.</line>
    <line>Revenge is my new thesis. Each kill, a page. Each broken shard, a footnote.</line>
    <line>You want to help? Then kill ten of them. And make it painful. Here—take this scroll. It tracks your work.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="kill" itemType="KillQuestScroll" ctorArgs="CrystalLatticeSeeker,10,8000">
    <line>Words won’t shatter a Seeker. Action will. Bring me ten shattered cores. Start now.</line>

  </entry>

  <!-- RED HERRINGS AND FLAVOR -->

  <entry keyword="hum">
    <line>They hum when they’re close. High-pitched, constant. It gets in your teeth.</line>
    <line>Ignore the hum if you want. Just don’t blame me when your staff liquefies.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="light">
    <line>They reflect light in unnatural ways—like they want you to stare into your own end.</line>
    <line>Sometimes the light they cast isn’t sunlight. It’s mana-light. Feeds them. Guides them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shards">
    <line>Break one and it explodes into shards—beautiful, razor-thin death.</line>
    <line>I collect their shards. Not for trophies—for study. To understand how to unmake them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>In deep caves, their hum echoes for miles. Sometimes, it answers itself.</line>
    <line>The echo isn’t just sound—it’s intent. Listen long enough, you’ll feel it think.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mentor">
    <line>She taught me everything I know. And then... one Seeker ended her in three notes.</line>
    <line>My mentor believed knowledge could tame them. She was wrong. Now I *hunt* them with what she taught me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="magic">
    <line>Magic fuels them. It excites their structure. Makes them hungry. Makes them dangerous.</line>
    <line>They aren’t evil. Just drawn to magic like iron to magnet. But what they *do* with it—that’s evil enough.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="core">
    <line>Every Seeker has a core—a glowing crystal heart. Break it, and the rest falls to dust.</line>
    <line>The core pulses with light, like it’s alive. Destroy that, and you kill the song.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Reflections lie around Seekers. Mirrors near them twist your image—like it shows what you’ll become.</line>
    <line>I once held a mirror up to one. It didn’t show the Seeker. Just a pulsing blue eye. It blinked.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dust">
    <line>Their dust lingers. Breathing it feels like inhaling static and secrets.</line>
    <line>Everything they touch leaves behind a shimmer—like starlight died and fell into powder.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="static">
    <line>The air crackles near them. Hair stands. Teeth itch. That’s when you should *run*.</line>
    <line>Static? No, not weather. The magic around them ionizes the *air*. Dead wizards call it 'arc-crackle.'</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silence">
    <line>They bring a strange silence. Like the world inhales when they arrive… and never exhales.</line>
    <line>Too much silence is never safe. With Seekers, silence means they're *listening*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="obsidian">
    <line>Some Seekers nest in obsidian hollows—perfect for resonance. Also perfect for ambush.</line>
    <line>Obsidian carries their hums further. You can hear one coming a full chamber away… if you’re lucky.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fragile">
    <line>They look fragile, don’t they? Like a glass sculpture. That’s the trick—they *want* you to think that.</line>
    <line>Crack the surface and you’ll learn what fragile isn’t. Their cores pulse harder the more you break them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pulse">
    <line>The pulse is rhythmic. Not quite a heartbeat. Not quite *natural*, either.</line>
    <line>One tried to sync with *my* pulse once. I felt it. Like a second heartbeat, inside my skull.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glow">
    <line>Their glow isn’t just light—it’s thought. That shine? It *learns* you.</line>
    <line>They glow brightest when you cast a spell. It excites them. Don’t excite them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trinket">
    <line>They’re drawn to magical trinkets. Wands, rings, enchanted buttons—they consume it all.</line>
    <line>Lost a trinket once. Later found it embedded in a Seeker’s rib. Still glowing.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fractal">
    <line>Zoom into their structure and you’ll see patterns within patterns. Infinite math. Infinite madness.</line>
    <line>Fractal growth—they build upon themselves like logic gone wild. It’s art. It’s horror.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scream">
    <line>They don’t scream. But break one right and you’ll hear something crack that *feels* like a scream.</line>
    <line>Some say they only scream when they *recognize* you. I don’t know if that’s better or worse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rift">
    <line>A rift once opened where a Seeker died. The air shimmered, the ground sang. I don’t know *why*.</line>
    <line>Seekers don’t belong here. Some believe they’re visitors from a failed dimension. Makes sense, somehow.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vengeance">
    <line>This isn’t just vengeance. It’s *correction*. The world’s off-balance with them alive.</line>
    <line>I don’t kill out of hate anymore. I kill out of necessity. Hate just makes it sweeter.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>My notes were written in anti-magical ink. The Seekers devoured the paper, left the ink swirling in the air.</line>
    <line>You ever see ink *lift* off a scroll? They make it happen. Like peeling thought from parchment.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="breath">
    <line>They don’t breathe. That’s the worst part. No panting. No rhythm. Just cold, deliberate *motion*.</line>
    <line>I held my breath near one once. Didn’t matter. It found me anyway. Breathless doesn't mean invisible.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="library">
    <line>The Grand Spire Library vanished overnight. One Seeker did that. Drank its wards, devoured its shelves.</line>
    <line>A scholar tried to archive their hum once. Now the archive *hums* without him.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bones">
    <line>They don’t crack bones—they disassemble them. Like taking apart a puzzle they’re bored with.</line>
    <line>If you find polished bones with no tool marks, just *gone*, you’ve found a Seeker’s feeding ground.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>Don’t sleep near them. Their hum finds your dreams and twists them into equations.</line>
    <line>Ever woken up with a math problem burned into your eyelids? No? Good. Keep it that way.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gravity">
    <line>Near them, gravity’s *wrong*. You’ll feel it sideways. Backwards. Inside-out, even.</line>
    <line>They warp space just a little. Just enough to make your stomach hate you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cave">
    <line>Seekers love caves. The silence helps them resonate. More magic echoes in stone.</line>
    <line>I once mapped a cavern full of them. Called it the Echoing Grave. Never went back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vibration">
    <line>They use vibrations like spiders use webs—tracking motion, power, weakness.</line>
    <line>Clap too loud near one and it’ll hear your *soul* quiver.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>Their song is not music—it’s mathematics. Magic encoded in tone and frequency.</line>
    <line>I recorded their song once. Played it back. Shattered the crystal in my ear.</line>

  <entry keyword="crystal">
    <line>Ah, crystals... perfect symmetry, eternal memory, deadly treachery.</line>
    <line>They refract light—and lies. Beautiful, yes. But beauty cuts deepest.</line>

  <entry keyword="elemental">
    <line>Crystal Elementals—living monuments to arcane perfection... and horror.</line>
    <line>They aren’t born. They’re *grown*. By magic, by pressure, by betrayal.</line>
    <line>Their cores pulse with stolen mana. I would know. One stole mine.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="beauty">
    <line>Their facets shimmer like frozen starlight. I used to weep at the sight. Now I grit my teeth.</line>
    <line>Beauty is a trap. The Elementals taught me that. One lured me in—then carved out my future.</line>
    <line>Not all lovely things are kind. Some are sharp. Some are cruel. Some walk on six crystal legs.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="core">
    <line>Every Crystal Elemental hides a core—pure, radiant, beating like a cold heart.</line>
    <line>I’ve held one in my hand. It hummed. It *remembered*. And then it cracked my palm open.</line>
    <line>Their core is both soul and sword. Break it, and the Elemental dies screaming.</line>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>If you stand still near one, you’ll hear it hum. A resonance of thought—or threat.</line>
    <line>They sing in frequencies only fools and madmen try to decode. I was both.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>They hate mirrors. Too much reflection. Too much truth.</line>
    <line>One shattered my mirror once. I think it saw itself and recoiled. Or maybe it just hated what it saw in me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="academy">
    <line>Moonglow's Academy banned my lectures after the incident. Said I was 'compromised by obsession'.</line>
    <line>The Academy wanted to harness the Elementals. I warned them. They didn’t listen. Now I lecture ghosts.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mana">
    <line>They feed on ambient mana. Like leeches, but sparkling.</line>
    <line>Drain the land, drain the mage—makes no difference. They *will* find a source to feed on.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eyes">
    <line>Don’t look into their facets. They reflect more than your face. They show regrets.</line>
    <line>Their eyes are illusions. Don’t be fooled. They see without seeing—like predators.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>This mark on my arm? That’s no burn. That’s what happens when a crystal hates you.</line>
    <line>I earned this scar translating their hum into glyphs. One glyph meant 'pain'. Guess which one I got wrong.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dust">
    <line>Crystal dust sticks to your soul. Shake it off, or you’ll start dreaming in angles.</line>
    <line>Too much dust in the lungs, and you begin to *hum*. Like them. Like it never left you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="forgive">
    <line>Forgive them? Would you forgive the knife that learned to walk?</line>
    <line>I forgave once. It cost me my colleagues, my hand, and my mind. No more.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="obsession">
    <line>Obsession is the tax of vision. I paid in blood, bone, and brilliance.</line>
    <line>They say I lost myself. I say I *found* something worse inside the crystals.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="reflection">
    <line>Their surfaces reflect your flaws. You look long enough, you won’t come back the same.</line>
    <line>Reflections lie. But crystal ones? They mock. And they *learn*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="light">
    <line>They bend light—create illusions, distort space. I once saw a sunrise bloom inside a cave.</line>
    <line>A trap of light. A lure. Like a spider’s silk in sunlight, waiting for awe to paralyze you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shard">
    <line>Tiny pieces still cut the deepest. That’s how they remind you they were whole once.</line>
    <line>I’ve swept shards from my skin more times than I can count. Some still hum in the drawer.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fractal">
    <line>Their bodies shift in fractals—patterns inside patterns. Like a maze with no center.</line>
    <line>I mapped one’s movements once. The pattern spelled a name. Mine.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>They don’t speak, but they whisper. Inside your mind, like wind through broken glass.</line>
    <line>After too long near them, I started whispering back. I still don’t know what I said.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glow">
    <line>The glow isn’t light—it’s stored memory. Touch one, and you *feel* its past.</line>
    <line>Each glow tells a story. The dim ones have forgotten it. The bright ones are still living it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="geometry">
    <line>Magic obeys geometry. So do they. They’re living runes, walking theorems of pain.</line>
    <line>I once thought their forms were divine. Turns out divinity doesn’t care if it kills you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flesh">
    <line>They don’t bleed. They don’t bruise. But they break—like flesh never does.</line>
    <line>Flesh envies crystal. Crystal envies nothing. That’s why it wins.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="envy">
    <line>I envied their perfection once. Now I pity it. Still envy it, though.</line>
    <line>Perfection isolates. That’s why they have no friends. Just fragments.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>I dream in shards now. Sharp dreams. Clean. They cut the nightmares into manageable pieces.</line>
    <line>They visit my dreams sometimes. Not to haunt. To study. I think I’m their thesis.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>Strike one, and the sound echoes through your bones. Like it’s judging your strength.</line>
    <line>Some echoes don’t bounce back. Some… stay inside you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pulse">
    <line>Their movement is pulsing—like a heartbeat slowed to torment.</line>
    <line>When they pulse, it’s not random. It’s rhythm. And rhythm always means language.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="betrayal">
    <line>I trusted one once. Not a phrase I say lightly. Or more than once.</line>
    <line>They don’t lie. But they *withhold*. Truth can be a betrayal too.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="collapse">
    <line>I saw one collapse into itself. Not die—retreat. As if ashamed to exist.</line>
    <line>When they collapse, listen. The song they make is… almost apologetic.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chime">
    <line>The sound they make when struck isn’t a noise. It’s a decision.</line>
    <line>Crystals don’t scream. They chime. But it means the same thing when you understand it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="touch">
    <line>Touch one bare-handed and you’ll hear voices. Not real ones. Worse—*familiar* ones.</line>
    <line>I touched one out of curiosity. It touched back out of contempt.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="time">
    <line>They don’t age. But they change. Like time is something they *choose* to obey.</line>
    <line>Some say they came from the future. Others say they *are* time, calcified.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gift">
    <line>One left me a crystal rose once. Grew it from the floor. Still waiting for it to wilt.</line>
    <line>They give gifts sometimes. Shards shaped like symbols. Just don’t accept the meaning.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="depth">
    <line>There’s more to them than the surface. Layered complexity. Like guilt pressed into stone.</line>
    <line>Every layer reflects a different truth. Look too long, and you forget which one was yours.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>I performed rituals to speak with them. It worked. Then it kept working.</line>
    <line>The circle was perfect. The invocation correct. The mistake was assuming they wanted to talk.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>Crystals don’t bleed—but mine did, when one impaled me. That’s how I learned the difference.</line>
    <line>My blood stained one once. It absorbed it. Now it glows a little red. Like it remembers me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trap">
    <line>I once trapped one in a prism rune. It laughed—then cracked my circle and my ribs.</line>
    <line>Don’t trap them. Fool’s errand. They trap *you* the moment you start to admire them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="anger">
    <line>I’m not angry. I’m focused. Anger burns fast. I burn slow—like magma under crystal.</line>
    <line>You mistake my tone for rage. This is clarity. Rage is too loud to be useful.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="collect">
    <line>I used to collect shards. Now I collect their deaths. Same shelf. Different gleam.</line>
    <line>My shelves held art once. Now they hold warning. Every shard, a lesson etched in regret.</line>

  <entry keyword="study">
    <line>I’ve charted their routes, recorded their feeding, and survived their rages. Not many can say that.</line>
    <line>Ten years observing them, until one mistook my daughter for a fish.</line>
    <line>I thought knowledge would protect me. It didn’t. But it gave me purpose.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>They surface at dusk. Hunt by sonar pulses—songlike, if you're foolish enough to listen.</line>
    <line>They nest in crystal caves below the continental shelf. Warm currents draw them up to feed.</line>
    <line>They don’t sleep. They sink and shimmer. Like nightmares conserving energy.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weakness">
    <line>They hate thunder. Something about low-frequency disruption. A well-placed sonic charge can scatter them.</line>
    <line>Their underbellies are softer—relatively speaking. Get under them, if you dare.</line>
    <line>The light—they fear being fully seen. Illusions falter under direct sunlight or fire-magic.</line>

  <entry keyword="hate">
    <line>Hate is too small a word. I *loathe* them, because I once *loved* them.</line>
    <line>I admired them. Wrote books. Lectured. Then one split my ship and took my child.</line>
    <line>Hate, yes. But professional hate. Educated hate. Useful hate.</line>

    <line>I watched one mirror the shape of a boat. Then crush it.</line>

  <entry keyword="chant">

  <entry keyword="lantern">
    <line>A lantern’s light bends near them. Like it fears what it might reveal.</line>
    <line>Use lanterns sparingly. Some lights lure them. Some lights offend them. You won’t know which.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="salt">
    <line>Their bodies reject salt, oddly. As if they don’t belong in the sea at all.</line>
    <line>Salted wounds don’t heal near them. Coincidence? I stopped believing in those.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="compulsion">
    <line>I watched a sailor walk into the sea. Smiling. Whispering. Eyes glassy as a serpent’s hide.</line>
    <line>They don’t pull you physically. They *invite* you. That’s worse.</line>

  <entry keyword="pulse">
    <line>When they get close, the sea itself pulses. Like a heartbeat. Like fear.</line>

  <entry keyword="glass">
    <line>Glass shatters near them. Not breaks—shatters. Like it *knows* it’s inadequate.</line>
    <line>I wore mirrored goggles once. Saw too much. I see fine now. I just *hear* things.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moonlight">
    <line>They rise under waning moons. Or when the tides feel wrong. There’s a pattern. I swear it.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shipwreck">
    <line>Serpents don’t cause all shipwrecks. But they *watch* them all.</line>

    <line>One vortex shattered near me once. I saw the way its fragments fell—each to a perfect distance. That’s not chaos. That’s *design*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="madness">
    <line>Madness isn’t seeing what’s false—it’s seeing what’s true and still smiling.</line>
    <line>The vortex doesn’t drive you mad. It helps you understand. That’s worse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fracture">
    <line>Fractures aren’t flaws—they’re maps. You just have to learn to read the break.</line>
    <line>One fracture spiraled into itself endlessly. I followed it too far. My hand still shakes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pulse">
    <line>Sometimes they pulse in rhythm with your heartbeat. Or maybe they *change* it.</line>
    <line>I once timed my watch to a vortex’s pulse. It never ticked right again.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spectrum">
    <line>They shine in colors that don’t exist. My mind invents names just to cope.</line>
    <line>You ever seen violet-black? No? Then you haven’t *really* seen a vortex.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="singing">
    <line>Their song isn’t heard—it’s felt, like grief or gravity.</line>
    <line>One vortex sang to me. A lullaby of entropy. I didn’t sleep for days.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ash">
    <line>Nothing burns them, not truly. You get ash, but it *remembers* its shape.</line>
    <line>I tried to burn a shard once. All I got was smoke and screaming. From me, not it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glass">
    <line>Don’t call them glass. Glass breaks. Vortex shards… transform.</line>
    <line>I once gave a shard to a glassblower. He screamed when it warped mid-fire.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gravity">
    <line>They don't just distort light—they bend space. I've dropped tools near one. They never fell *straight*.</line>
    <line>Stand near one long enough and your compass weeps.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>It’s said their presence curdles blood. I’ve seen it clot in the vial while I watched.</line>
    <line>One of my apprentices bled near a shard. The blood crystallized mid-air.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dust">
    <line>Their dust floats forever. I swept it for hours. It's still in my lungs.</line>
    <line>Crushed a shard once. Became dust. Then it *moved*—like it missed being whole.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>Look into one too long and it looks back. Not metaphorically.</line>
    <line>They don’t have eyes. They *are* eyes. Watching. Judging. Reflecting what you fear.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>Don’t dream near them. Your mind will build its own vortex inside.</line>
    <line>Sleep comes slow these days. Slower still when the hum gets louder.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cold">
    <line>They’re cold, but not from temperature. Like standing in a memory that hates you.</line>
    <line>Touched one once. My fingertips went numb. The feeling never *completely* came back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="map">
    <line>I tried to map their locations. They moved. Not the vortexes—the *landscape*.</line>
    <line>Each vortex forms a point. Together, they draw a symbol. What it means… I'm not ready to know.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="jewel">
    <line>Some fool merchants call them ‘jewels.’ Fine. Let them wear death on a chain.</line>
    <line>A noble tried to mount one in a ring. His hand’s still twitching in the palace vault.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="static">
    <line>The air crackles near them—like lightning waiting to happen.</line>
    <line>Static in your hair. Static in your teeth. Then your memories jump tracks.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="reflection">
    <line>They don’t reflect your face—they reflect your *past*. Or one that could’ve been.</line>
    <line>One shard showed me my childhood. Then it twisted the smile into a scream.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bone">
    <line>Bones near vortexes go brittle. Seen one snap under a whisper of wind.</line>
    <line>I buried a sample near a cow skeleton. Came back two days later—no skeleton. Just white dust.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="note">
    <line>Every vortex hums a different note. Play them right and you get a chord of madness.</line>
    <line>The notes aren’t random. They’re a *language*. One we’ve forgotten... or were made to forget.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="breath">
    <line>Sometimes, it feels like they breathe. Not inhale. Not exhale. Just… *exist* in rhythm.</line>
    <line>If the air around you thickens, hold your breath. It might not be yours anymore.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="halo">
    <line>I saw a vortex cast a halo once. Light like a crown of broken promises.</line>
    <line>Halos don’t mean holiness. Not when they spin like a blade.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vein">
    <line>They grow like veins through the stone—crystal roots, feeding on silence.</line>
    <line>I traced one’s growth underground. Came back up twenty feet from where I started.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chime">
    <line>They chime when threatened. Not with sound—through *your teeth*.</line>
    <line>I once heard a chime from my study. There were no wind chimes. Only a shard… and the warning.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hum">
    <line>The hum is always there. Even when you're nowhere near.</line>
    <line>If you hear the hum in your dreams, wake up. Quickly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gleam">
    <line>They gleam like treasure—but every gleam cuts.</line>
    <line>Shiny. Hypnotic. Lethal. Like a lover you never really knew.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="theory">
    <line>I wrote ten treatises on them. Burned them all. They made sense. That was the danger.</line>
    <line>Theory only goes so far. Action takes you the rest of the way—and sometimes off a cliff.</line>
  </entry>
</trait>


<trait name="Crystal Wisp Expert" priority="40">
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>I study the shimmer-dwellers—Crystal Wisps. Beauty and menace in equal measure.</line>
    <line>Some call me mad. Others call me ‘Wisp Watcher’. I’ve heard them hum in my dreams.</line>
    <line>I record the habits of Crystal Wisps. Each note etched with regret.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="crystal">
    <line>They shine like frozen stars. You'd never guess their touch burns the soul.</line>
    <line>The crystals aren't just light—they store memory, stolen from those who stare too long.</line>
    <line>I've collected their shards. Beautiful. Painful. Like heartbreak you can hold.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wisp">
    <line>They drift like thoughts, whisper like regrets. Don’t be fooled—they’re predators.</line>
    <line>A Crystal Wisp looks harmless—until your mind starts leaking through your ears.</line>
    <line>They don’t kill fast. They unmake you slowly, like fog over fire.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hatred">
    <line>I once followed one too far into the glimmering woods. Only I returned. My brother didn’t.</line>
    <line>Hate? No. What I feel is… devotion inverted. They took everything. I just want it back.</line>
    <line>Every shimmer reminds me of the silence that followed. That’s why I burn their nests.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>Some say they sing. If you hear it, it’s too late. You’re already part of the harmony.</line>
    <line>Their song isn't for ears—it's for thoughts. A lullaby that unravels the mind.</line>
    <line>You ever heard a crystal wail? I have. At night. It sounds like guilt made music.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>They gather near ley-lines, shimmer-lakes, or anywhere moonlight refuses to sit still.</line>
    <line>Wisps love stillness. They’ll hover over silent ponds, or above the breathless dying.</line>
    <line>They feed on magic—yours, mine, the world's. Every spark makes them brighter.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shard">
    <line>Their shards hum softly when no one's watching. I keep one in my satchel. I hate myself for it.</line>
    <line>A broken wisp leaves a shard. Dangerous, but useful. Like the teeth of a dead snake.</line>
    <line>Some mages crave the shards. Me? I crush them under boot. Revenge is ugly, but honest.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="slay" itemType="KillQuestScroll" ctorArgs="CrystalWisp,10,9000">
    <line>You want to help? Slay ten Crystal Wisps. Bring back silence. I’ll give you a tracker.</line>
    <line>No more words—action. Take this scroll. Hunt ten of them, and maybe I’ll sleep again.</line>
    <line>Slay ten. No more, no less. That’s how many sang when he vanished.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- RED HERRINGS / LORE FLAVOR -->

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>They hate reflections. Or love them. Hard to tell with things made of light and lies.</line>
    <line>I tried trapping one with mirrors once. It multiplied instead. Worst day of my life.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="brother">
    <line>He followed a wisp into a hollow grove. I heard the humming. Then… nothing.</line>
    <line>They say he vanished. I say they erased him. Left me with echoes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hollow">
    <line>There’s a place they gather—Crystal Hollow. It pulses at night like a second moon.</line>
    <line>The Hollow glows even when there's no moon. I don’t go there. Not anymore.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="light">
    <line>Their glow isn’t warm. It’s cold—like moonlight on bone.</line>
    <line>Some mages say their light holds secrets. I say it holds traps.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="madness">
    <line>Too many nights watching them float. I started dreaming in whispers.</line>
    <line>If I start laughing, walk away. That means they’re near.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="veil">
    <line>They drift along the edges of the veil—between real and not. Dangerous territory.</line>
    <line>When they cross the veil, they leave frost behind. Memory frost, some call it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pulse">
    <line>Crystal Wisps pulse like heartbeats. Maybe that’s their soul. Maybe it’s what they stole from us.</line>
    <line>Each pulse is a thought. I’ve counted them. They think in thirteens.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glow">
    <line>Don’t follow the glow. That’s how they get you.</line>
    <line>The glow bends around truth. You’ll see what you want—until it’s too late.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="snow">
    <line>They come out when snow falls. The cold slows minds, makes it easier for them to slip in.</line>
    <line>Their glow looks brightest in snow. Like hope. But it’s a lie.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rain">
    <line>They vanish when it rains. Or hide. Or maybe they become the rain. Still haven’t decided.</line>
    <line>The first time I saw one was during a storm. Lightning flashed—and there it was, hovering, waiting.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>I dreamed of a field of them once. They hummed my name in harmony. I woke up bleeding from the ears.</line>
    <line>They slip into dreams like silk through fingers. You won’t even know what’s real when you wake up.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="map">
    <line>I charted their appearances. The dots made a symbol. Then the paper caught fire on its own.</line>
    <line>Maps don’t help. They drift off course, follow feelings, not roads. Try tracking emotion instead.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clock">
    <line>They disrupt timepieces. Every clock near a wisp starts ticking backward. It’s not just unsettling—it’s dangerous.</line>
    <line>Set a clock near one, and it spins. Hours vanish. So do memories, if you’re not careful.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moth">
    <line>They move like moths, but hungrier. Smarter. And they never burn, no matter the flame.</line>
    <line>Moths fly toward light. Wisps *are* light. Think about what that means.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="book">
    <line>I once read an ancient tome that described them as 'angels without morality'. That page was torn out when I returned.</line>
    <line>Books about them often go blank over time. As if the knowledge… unwrites itself.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>They don’t respond to music, but some instruments stop working around them. Harps go quiet. Violins scream.</line>
    <line>One bard played near them. His lute melted. He just kept humming afterward. Still does.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="child">
    <line>Children sometimes see them when adults don’t. They call them ‘the floaty friends’. Terrifying.</line>
    <line>A village lost three children during a festival of lights. The only clue? Crystalline dust on their pillows.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cold">
    <line>Their presence drops the temperature. Like joy being sucked from the air.</line>
    <line>It’s not the cold you feel—it’s the absence of warmth. There's a difference, and it's horrifying.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="color">
    <line>No one agrees on what color they are. Some say blue. Others pink, silver, black. Maybe they're all correct.</line>
    <line>Their color depends on what you fear most. Mine always shimmer red.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feather">
    <line>Found a feather once, near where one disappeared. But no birds in sight. Odd, isn’t it?</line>
    <line>Wisps don’t have wings. But somehow feathers turn up near them. Theory? Echoes of something older.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silence">
    <line>Before they arrive, everything goes silent. No wind. No bugs. Like the world holds its breath.</line>
    <line>They don’t like noise. Or maybe they erase it. I’ve heard laughter turn to silence mid-note.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>They distort ink. My notes rewrite themselves overnight. One diagram sketched *me* back.</line>
    <line>Ever watched ink climb upward on a page? I have. It spelled my name—backward.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="star">
    <line>Some say they’re fallen stars. But stars don’t whisper. Do they?</line>
    <line>They hover beneath constellations as if waiting for something. Like instructions.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="salt">
    <line>Salt lines don’t stop them. They *laugh* at salt. Not audibly, but you’ll *feel* it.</line>
    <line>I poured salt in a circle once. One hovered right through it. Then every candle in the house went out.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>They don’t cast shadows. That’s what gives them away. Light without shadow is a lie made visible.</line>
    <line>Once, I saw a shadow move without a wisp. The reverse can happen, too. Think on that.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glass">
    <line>They leave no reflection in mirrors, but crack glass just by passing near. Seen it. Felt it.</line>
    <line>I had a crystal ball crack open when one passed. It whispered a date—still waiting to see what happens.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="voice">
    <line>Sometimes they mimic voices. Familiar ones. A cruel trick if you're already grieving.</line>
    <line>One spoke with my brother’s voice. But he’s been dead five years. That wasn't comfort—that was cruelty.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="thread">
    <line>I tied a red thread from my wrist to a wisp once. For study. When I woke, the thread was inside my skin.</line>
    <line>Threads appear in places they pass. Webs of thought? Or traps? Hard to say.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>They whisper in dreams. I’ve woken with strange symbols in my notes I don’t remember writing.</line>
    <line>When they whisper, you forget names. Your own, if you’re not careful.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="touch">
    <line>They don’t need to touch skin. Thought-touch is worse. It *changes* things inside.</line>
    <line>One brushed me once. I remembered my mother’s death in reverse. Never again.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>You look too long into them, and they look back.</line>
    <line>Their eyes? They don’t have any. That’s what makes the staring worse.</line>
  </entry>
</trait>


<trait name="Cursed Lorekeeper" priority="40">
  <entry keyword="cursed">
    <line>They are the husks of ambition—what's left when magic consumes the soul.</line>
    <line>The Cursed are not born; they're made. Willingly or not, every one was once human.</line>
    <line>You call them monsters. I once called them subjects. That was... before the incident.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>They whisper to each other—but not in words. Echoes, shudders, clicks. The sound of ruined minds.</line>
    <line>They linger near ley lines and graveyards, feeding off arcane residue.</line>
    <line>Motionless by day. Restless by night. Drawn to sound, warmth, and memories of who they were.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="magic">
    <line>Magic made them—and magic still binds them. Poorly. Like stitching flesh with smoke.</line>
    <line>Their bodies are spells barely holding together. Disrupt the flow, and they fall apart.</line>
    <line>The Cursed are walking enchantments. Unstable. Hungry. And offended by silence.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="voice">
    <line>They mimic the voices of loved ones. It's how they lure you in.</line>
    <line>Heard one scream my name once. My real name. No one alive knows it.</line>
    <line>You hear a Cursed sing, you run. Don’t stop. Don’t look back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="reason">
    <line>I made one. Long ago. Thought I could contain the corruption. I was wrong.</line>
    <line>One wore my brother’s face. For weeks. Until I burned it.</line>
    <line>They cost me everything—my work, my family, my faith. But they left me my hatred. That’s enough.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="slay" itemType="KillQuestScroll" ctorArgs="Cursed,12,9000">
    <line>End them. Twelve of them. Each kill, a stitch undone in their legacy.</line>
    <line>If you seek redemption, or just coin, kill twelve Cursed. Take this scroll. I won’t weep.</line>
    <line>Slay twelve, and maybe—just maybe—you'll hear fewer whispers at night. This scroll will guide you.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Red Herrings & Flavor -->

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>They form rings of ash, broken glass, and teeth. Nobody knows why. Nobody wants to.</line>
    <line>Some say the Cursed can’t die unless their ritual is undone. I say a sword works just fine.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Never show them a mirror. They don't see themselves—they see what they lost.</line>
    <line>I caught one staring into broken glass. Laughing. Then crying. Then it saw me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>The Cursed don’t sleep. But they do rest. Still as corpses, dreaming someone else’s dreams.</line>
    <line>If you see one sleeping, it’s a trap. Or worse—an invitation.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eyes">
    <line>Their eyes glow. Not with power—with memory. Things they want back.</line>
    <line>Look into their eyes, and you’ll see your own regrets looking back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="book">
    <line>I wrote a book about them. Burned it. But sometimes... I still find pages.</line>
    <line>Knowledge is a curse too. Mine just happens to bite back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pain">
    <line>Pain drives them. Not anger. Not hunger. Pain without end, given legs.</line>
    <line>You can’t reason with pain. You can only silence it. Briefly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scent">
    <line>They smell like burned paper and old sorrow.</line>
    <line>A scent like cold stone and forgotten candles—if you smell that, run.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Their shadows move first. Watch the floor, not the face.</line>
    <line>Light bends around them like it’s afraid. You should be too.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="memory">
    <line>Some say they steal memories. I say they *become* them.</line>
    <line>They know things no one should. Things only I ever said aloud, once, long ago.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Fire cleanses. Not always, but often enough. Burn them.</line>
    <line>They don’t scream when they burn. They *sigh*. That’s worse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whispers">
    <line>They never speak. Just whisper. Like wind through bone.</line>
    <line>Heard them whisper once. It was my name, in my mother’s voice. She died twenty years ago.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ash">
    <line>Everywhere they walk, ash follows. Not from fire—just... endings.</line>
    <line>Woke up covered in ash once. No fire nearby. Just silence.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="strings">
    <line>Sometimes they twitch—like puppets with frayed strings.</line>
    <line>I saw one hanging from nothing, arms limp, jerking like it remembered how to dance.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bones">
    <line>They leave bones in patterns. Circles. Spirals. Maps no sane mind could read.</line>
    <line>I found bones in my bedroll once. Still warm. Still humming.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clock">
    <line>Time runs differently near them. My watch spun backward. My tea boiled cold.</line>
    <line>I spent five minutes watching one. Came back and the moon was gone.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="child">
    <line>Some look like children. They're not. Don’t fall for it.</line>
    <line>Once saw a Cursed cradle an empty blanket and hum a lullaby. I still dream about it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="veil">
    <line>They walk like they’re underwater, like there’s a veil we can’t see.</line>
    <line>One passed by and the world felt… thinner. Like waking up mid-dream.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>Their screams echo in places you haven’t walked yet.</line>
    <line>Heard an echo repeat my words… wrong. Too many teeth in the sound.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>I wrote their names once. The ink bled off the page and into my hand.</line>
    <line>Never write about them in red ink. You won’t like what answers.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="threshold">
    <line>They won’t cross thresholds without invitation. Unless you forget to close the door.</line>
    <line>One stood outside my door all night. Didn’t knock. Didn’t leave. Just waited.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smile">
    <line>Some smile. That's the worst part. Like they remember joy, but only the shape of it.</line>
    <line>That smile isn’t human. It’s just teeth and memory arranged to deceive.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="storm">
    <line>They come before storms. Or cause them. I’m not sure anymore.</line>
    <line>The air thickens before they arrive—like thunder without sound.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glass">
    <line>They avoid glass, unless they’re staring into it. I’ve seen one shatter a mirror, then eat the shards.</line>
    <line>Caught one pressing its face against a window. Left no fog. Just frost and cracks.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>They show up in dreams before you meet them. If you’re lucky, it’s just once.</line>
    <line>I dreamed of hands pulling me downward. Woke up with scratches. No soil. No blood. Just fear.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hunger">
    <line>They don’t eat. But they *hunger*. Difference is subtle, deadly.</line>
    <line>Their hunger isn’t for food. It’s for being remembered.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fireplace">
    <line>They hate fire, but love fireplaces. Found one crouched in an unlit hearth, smiling.</line>
    <line>Something about hearths draws them—maybe the echo of warmth. Maybe irony.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="stairs">
    <line>They never use stairs. Just... appear upstairs. I don’t ask how.</line>
    <line>One moment I was alone downstairs. Next moment, footsteps above. Just mine, but faster.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="teeth">
    <line>Teeth—too many, too sharp. Some don’t open their mouths. Others never close them.</line>
    <line>One dropped a pile of human teeth before attacking. None were its own.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dust">
    <line>They leave dust wherever they go. But not like dirt—this dust *moves*.</line>
    <line>Wipe it away, and it comes back. In your lungs. In your dreams.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bell">
    <line>A bell rings before some arrive. No bell to be seen. Just sound, and then silence.</line>
    <line>I heard a bell at midnight. When I looked outside, everything had stopped moving—except one.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="heartbeat">
    <line>Around them, your heartbeat slows. As if your body’s unsure if it should keep going.</line>
    <line>I once fainted near one—not from fear. From rhythm. Mine stopped. Theirs didn’t.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flesh">
    <line>Flesh peels from them like smoke. But only when you stare too long.</line>
    <line>Their flesh remembers being alive. That’s the problem—it refuses to forget.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>Heard a Cursed humming once. A lullaby I haven’t heard since my father vanished.</line>
    <line>If you hear music in the woods, turn around. That’s not a bard—it’s a baited hook.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gift">
    <line>They offer gifts sometimes. Never accept. One gave me a ring once. Still won’t come off.</line>
    <line>A gift from the Cursed is always a curse, wrapped in charm and teeth.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="name">
    <line>They don’t have names. Not anymore. But they *remember* yours.</line>
    <line>Names have power. That’s why they whisper yours from the dark.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cold">
    <line>The air chills when they’re near. Not from fear. From magic that forgot how to live.</line>
    <line>I felt a Cursed pass by once. Didn’t see it. Just frost. And the sound of my own heartbeat slowing.</line>

  <entry keyword="cursedsoul">
    <line>Ah... the Cursed Souls. Wretched echoes of lives unfulfilled. I’ve studied them more than I sleep.</line>
    <line>Cursed Souls are not ghosts, not quite. They're trapped between agony and memory, clawing for meaning.</line>
    <line>You’ve seen them? Then you know—those hollow eyes, the whispering moans. Beautiful. Horrible.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hate">
    <line>They took her from me. The one I loved. Left her hollow, shrieking in the fog, not even knowing her name.</line>
    <line>Hate? Yes. But not for what they are—for what they do. They devour the soul, leave the shell to scream.</line>
    <line>I hate them because I *understand* them. Because I almost became one.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="love">
    <line>She was a priestess. Kind, clever, a light in the mire. She tried to heal a Cursed Soul. It consumed her.</line>
    <line>Love is no shield against curses. I learned that. So did she.</line>
    <line>I still hear her voice sometimes—in their wails. Or maybe I’ve gone mad.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>They gather in ruins and graveyards. Places where memory clings like cobwebs.</line>
    <line>The Cursed Souls don’t walk—they drift. But where sorrow pools, they come.</line>
    <line>They circle shrines and old battlegrounds, drawn to suffering like moths to flame.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weakness">
    <line>They abhor consecrated ground. Step into it, and they scream—some flee.</line>
    <line>Light disrupts them. True light. Holy relics. Fire’s no use unless it’s blessed.</line>
    <line>They are already dead. You must break the magic that binds them—not just the body.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="voice">
    <line>Their voice is a whisper on the edge of hearing. Some say it's how they lure you.</line>
    <line>If you hear your own name in the wind, leave. It means a Cursed Soul has noticed you.</line>
    <line>Their voices are fragmented memory—songs, prayers, screams. All jumbled, all wrong.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="quest">
    <line>You wish to help? Then silence them. Ten Cursed Souls. End their torment—and mine.</line>
    <line>If you mean to fight them, prove it. Slay ten. Bring this scroll—it will bind their essence for study.</line>
    <line>I’ve lost too much. If you would offer mercy or vengeance, take this scroll and destroy ten Cursed Souls.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Red herrings & flavor -->

  <entry keyword="fog">
    <line>They move with the fog. No wind, no breeze—just the cold mist and their wails.</line>
    <line>When the fog rolls in, stay indoors. It brings memories... and them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="graves">
    <line>They don’t rise from graves—they *find* them. Sit by them. Whisper to them.</line>
    <line>A fresh grave draws them. So does an old one. Anything with sorrow left in it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>They hate mirrors. They show them what they were... or what they never became.</line>
    <line>Place a mirror near one—they recoil. Some break into sobs. Others rage.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>I have a scar across my soul. Invisible—but I feel it burn when they draw near.</line>
    <line>She left me a scar, the day she became one of them. A gift. A curse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="soul">
    <line>The soul is not immortal. Not as people think. It can be broken, fragmented, stolen.</line>
    <line>These things we call Cursed Souls... they are not souls anymore. They are what’s *left* after hope dies.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="night">
    <line>They grow stronger at night. Not because of darkness—but because memory walks freer.</line>
    <line>In daylight they fade. In night, they remember—and remembering gives them strength.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="light">
    <line>Holy light burns them. But mundane torches? Useless. They thrive in that glow.</line>
    <line>Light doesn’t hurt them—*truth* does. Light that reveals. Light that judges.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="book">
    <line>I’ve written a tome on them. But it’s bound in silence, sealed in my thoughts. Too dangerous to share.</line>
    <line>Books rot in time. But the memory of her... the memory of *them*... stays sharp.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ashes">
    <line>I once tried to burn a Cursed Soul’s remains. The fire went cold. The ashes screamed.</line>
    <line>Their ashes don’t settle. I keep a vial that stirs itself at night.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>Sleep? Hah. I haven’t truly slept since she vanished into the fog.</line>
    <line>They visit my dreams. Or maybe I visit theirs. Either way, I wake cold.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>The whispers don’t stop. They’re not voices—they’re regrets. Unspoken, but felt.</line>
    <line>I hear whispers in empty rooms now. They call my name, but never in her voice.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="candle">
    <line>Keep a candle lit at night. They fear steady flame. Or maybe they just hate hope.</line>
    <line>She used to light three candles before bed. One for the lost. One for the dead. One for the forgotten.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chains">
    <line>Some wear chains—not of metal, but of memory. You’ll hear them clink if you listen.</line>
    <line>They don’t bind others—they’re bound themselves. Shackled to old guilt, ancient wounds.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eyes">
    <line>Never meet their eyes. You might see someone you knew. You might see yourself.</line>
    <line>Their eyes shimmer like tears that never fell. That’s how they trap you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="altar">
    <line>I found an altar once. Covered in names carved backward. They whispered when the moon rose.</line>
    <line>Cursed Souls circle altars like wolves around a grave. Hungry. Reverent. Lost.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>The wind doesn’t blow near them. It *avoids* them. As if the world itself recoils.</line>
    <line>There’s always a stillness before they arrive. Like the air itself holds its breath.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="thread">
    <line>Life is a thread. Their thread snapped, then rewove itself into something wrong.</line>
    <line>I tried to follow the thread of her fate once. It led me here. It ends in screams.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="veil">
    <line>The veil between life and death is thinner near them. Some say they’ve seen across.</line>
    <line>Step too close and you’ll feel it—the veil fluttering. Like breath on your neck.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>They don’t speak. They echo. Words said long ago, regret etched into syllables.</line>
    <line>One echoed my own voice once. Mocking. Pleading. I haven’t spoken aloud since.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>They don’t bleed. But something stains the ground when they vanish.</line>
    <line>Some say Cursed Souls were born in blood. I say they were born in silence.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>A bard once tried to play for them. The strings snapped. The air turned cold. He plays no more.</line>
    <line>There’s music in their moans, if you listen. A melody of despair. I tried to write it once. I burned the page.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grave">
    <line>Some say if you speak a Cursed Soul’s name at their grave, they rest. I’ve tried. They don’t.</line>
    <line>They linger near unmarked graves. As if searching for their name.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feathers">
    <line>Found a black feather near a soul’s remains once. No birds around. Still warm.</line>
    <line>Some say feathers ward them off. Others say it draws them closer. Try it. Let me know.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dust">
    <line>They leave no footprints. Only dust. Dust that clings to memory more than cloth.</line>
    <line>Wipe the dust from your boots before you enter a holy place. They say it carries sorrow.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clock">
    <line>My clocks stop at midnight. Only start again when the first crow calls. Every night.</line>
    <line>Time slips near them. You’ll lose hours. Or live the same moment twice. Or worse, remember something that never happened.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smile">
    <line>They try to smile sometimes. It’s... wrong. Like a mask cracking.</line>
    <line>She smiled at me once. After she changed. That broke me more than her scream ever could.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hand">
    <line>You’ll feel a cold hand on your shoulder before they appear. It’s not theirs. It’s the memory of touch.</line>
    <line>They reach out—not to harm. To *remember*. That’s worse, somehow.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="name">
    <line>If a Cursed Soul speaks your name, don’t answer. Don’t *think* about answering.</line>
    <line>They collect names. Whisper them to each other. Why? No one knows. I hope to never find out.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>They say a ritual created the first Cursed Soul—a grief-stricken mage binding her lover to life.</line>
    <line>Rituals keep them bound. End the ritual, you end the soul. But beware—the binding fights back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tears">
    <line>A Cursed Soul cannot cry. But they remember what it meant to weep.</line>
    <line>I cried enough for both of us. Now I kill them, and never shed a tear.</line>

    <line>Grace wrapped in savagery. They are beauty given claws.</line>
    <line>The Cu Sidhe—fae-born hounds of the green. Don’t let the fur fool you.</line>
    <line>They will not bark. They do not warn. They appear... and something in you dies a little.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fur">
    <line>Their fur glows in moonlight—green, silver, dusk-grey. Enchanted to charm. Don’t fall for it.</line>
    <line>I once brushed my hand along Cu Sidhe fur. It purred... then bit through bone.</line>
    <line>Soft, yes. But each strand’s a memory of someone who trusted too easily.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bite">
    <line>Silent. Sharp. Too quick to dodge. Pray it kills you clean.</line>
    <line>A Cu Sidhe bite infects. Not with poison—but with dreams. Ugly, luring dreams.</line>
    <line>You’ll know it’s bitten you when the pain fades... and the nightmares begin.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>They hum when they hunt. Some say it’s the wind. I know better.</line>
    <line>There’s a rhythm to their breath. Ancient, wrong. You’ll feel it before you hear it.</line>
    <line>If you hear the forest singing, run. Or dig a hole and hope they pass you by.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hate">
    <line>I loved one once. Fed it. Named it. It waited three winters... then killed my sister.</line>
    <line>Hate is the last mercy I give them. It keeps me from remembering the rest.</line>
    <line>You don’t hate Cu Sidhe because they’re monsters. You hate them because they make you forget they are.</line>

    <line>I've studied them. I’ve tracked them. I’ve killed six—and still dream of the first.</line>

  <entry keyword="howl">
    <line>They don't howl at the moon. The moon howls for them.</line>
    <line>A Cu Sidhe’s howl breaks no silence—it replaces it.</line>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>Emerald eyes. Empty of mercy. Full of memory.</line>
    <line>They look at you like they know your first lie. And your last hope.</line>

    <line>Fae made them, or maybe found them. Either way, they serve only beauty and blood.</line>
    <line>There are rules with fae. With Cu Sidhe? Only instinct.</line>

    <line>I heard one whisper once. It said my name backwards.</line>

    <line>You cannot leash one. But they might leash *you*.</line>

    <line>One watched me from the trees for hours. Then blinked and vanished. Still feel that blink in my bones.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sister">
    <line>I told you—Cu Sidhe wait. She trusted mine. And it *waited.*</line>
    <line>She fed it with bare hands. It licked her, gently. Then the throat. Then silence.</line>

  <entry keyword="amulet">
    <line>This? A fang. From the seventh I killed. Carved into memory.</line>
    <line>The fang still hums when they’re near. That’s how I know I’m never alone.</line>

  <entry keyword="paw">
    <line>Cu Sidhe tracks vanish when you blink. Their paws touch ground like memories touch skin.</line>
    <line>Paws too large for silence. And yet—no sound. That’s the part that stays with you.</line>

  <entry keyword="mist">
    <line>They walk best in mist. Maybe they *are* mist, wearing fur and teeth for fun.</line>
    <line>The mist is not your ally. It keeps their secrets better than any mage.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Their shadow moves before they do. That’s how I survived—once.</line>
    <line>Don’t watch their shape. Watch the shadows around it. They move wrong.</line>

  <entry keyword="thorn">
    <line>I found thorn-scars on a tree, spiraling upward. Cu Sidhe trail, or warning? Doesn’t matter—I ran.</line>
    <line>Thorns and fangs—they don’t stab, they *whisper*. A Cu Sidhe’s trail often bleeds.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>They love the moon. Or maybe it loves them. Either way, they hunt best under it.</line>
    <line>Full moon once meant harvest. Now it means howling and lost travelers.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scent">
    <line>They smell like pine and rain. And something underneath that says 'run.'</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bone">
    <line>Cu Sidhe gnaw bone not to feed—but to *shape* it. I’ve seen their art. It remembers pain.</line>

    <line>The wind bends around them, like it’s afraid to interrupt.</line>
    <line>Cu Sidhe never fight the wind. They *ride* it, howl and all.</line>

    <line>Cu Sidhe don’t break silence. They *become* it.</line>
    <line>A clearing without birdsong isn’t empty. It’s occupied.</line>

  <entry keyword="bark">
    <line>They never bark. The noise they make is worse. Lower. Inside your chest.</line>
    <line>I heard a Cu Sidhe bark once. It wasn’t a warning—it was a verdict.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tears">
    <line>Cried once after killing one. Didn’t know why. It was like ending a song.</line>
    <line>They don’t cry. But they make others cry in ways they don’t understand.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="name">
    <line>Don’t name a Cu Sidhe. It remembers. And names you back.</line>
    <line>A named hound can find you across worlds. I’ve burned that knowledge into my skin.</line>

  <entry keyword="roots">
    <line>Where Cu Sidhe walk, roots twist. Not to trip you—just to remind you they’re there.</line>
    <line>I stepped on roots near their grove. Heard them shift like a sigh. Never ran faster.</line>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Hold a mirror up when one’s near. If it shows two forests, drop it and leave.</line>
    <line>Cu Sidhe don’t have reflections. Or they have too many. Both are dangerous.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gift">
    <line>Sometimes they leave gifts—bones, flowers, dead rabbits with cleaned fur. Never accept.</line>
    <line>The gift of a Cu Sidhe is a contract. One sealed in silence and regret.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="circle">
    <line>They pace in perfect circles before sleeping. Spiral traps for the curious.</line>
    <line>If you see pawprints in a circle, don’t step in. It’s waiting for you to complete it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>Cu Sidhe enter dreams like smoke under a door. You won’t know until you wake with claw marks.</line>
    <line>I once dreamt I was one of them. When I woke, I had fur on my tongue.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="laughter">
    <line>Once I heard laughter in the glade. Not human. Not safe. Followed it. Found pawprints.</line>
    <line>Cu Sidhe don’t laugh. But something around them does.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tail">
    <line>Their tails aren’t just for balance. They twitch before they strike—if you’re lucky.</line>

    <line>Don’t mistake a lack of depth for lack of insight. They see right through lies.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>Cyclopses love echoes. They scream into caves and laugh at the replies.</line>
    <line>If the mountain answers you twice, leave. That second voice isn’t yours.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>Cyclopses sleep with one eye open. No joke. No eyelid. Just… watching.</line>
    <line>They sleep sitting up, like statues. Until they’re not.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>Heard one hum once. Deep, mournful. Like the mountain itself weeping.</line>
    <line>Their songs aren’t for us. But if you hear one, don’t interrupt. Ever.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>Some paint symbols on their arms in ash and blood. Meanings lost, but rage? Still fresh.</line>
    <line>Cyclops ink isn’t for art—it’s for memory. They wear their dead like tattoos.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>They don’t fear fire. They *respect* it. There’s a difference—and you’ll feel it if you’re wrong.</line>
    <line>A cyclops once walked through a campfire just to prove it wasn’t scared. Burned everything but its pride.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="metal">
    <line>They don’t forge. But they *find*. Broken swords, shields—they wear them like jewelry.</line>
    <line>Saw one once with a breastplate welded to its arm. Not for defense—just looked meaner.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fog">
    <line>Fog rolls in? Cyclopses get loud. They love confusion. And smashing things in it.</line>
    <line>You hear stomping in fog? It’s not thunder. It’s something far worse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="owl">
    <line>They fear owls. Or maybe *respect* them. Never seen one go near a screeching tree.</line>
    <line>My brother said owls were the watchers of watchers. He was weird like that.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="salt">
    <line>Salt cracks their skin. Not lethal. Just irritating. That’s why I lace my traps with it.</line>
    <line>Salt the earth, salt the meat, salt the wounds—it all works on cyclopses, somehow.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>They hate strong winds. Throws off their balance. That one eye doesn’t help much with depth.</line>
    <line>Watched one roar at the wind for a full hour once. Eventually punched a tree. The tree lost.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="child">
    <line>Baby cyclopses look like old men. Wrinkled, loud, and already swinging sticks.</line>
    <line>They raise their young in pits. No light, just grunts and rocks. Explains a lot.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silence">
    <line>A cyclops being *quiet* is the scariest thing. It means it’s thinking.</line>
    <line>The last time I heard one go silent, it was circling us. Took two before we even smelled it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bones">
    <line>They don’t just kill—they arrange. Skeletons like puzzles. It’s art, or madness, or both.</line>
    <line>Found bones spiraled in the dirt once. Cyclops art, maybe. Or a warning.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>Something about the full moon makes them restless. Like the tide, but angrier.</line>
    <line>They howl at the moon, but not in worship. It’s grief. Pure and ancient.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="food">
    <line>They’ll eat anything. Stones, branches, meat, memory. Don’t get in the way.</line>
    <line>Cyclops cuisine? Whatever they can punch into submission and chew.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>Do they dream? Gods, I hope not. What could haunt *them*?</line>
    <line>My brother once claimed cyclopses dreamed of the sea. He never explained why.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>If you see one but not its shadow, run. Something’s wrong. Something’s *very* wrong.</line>
    <line>They cast long shadows. Too long. Sometimes the shadow moves first.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grip">
    <line>They don’t throw you. They *grip* you until you stop moving. Then they forget you existed.</line>
    <line>I saw one crush a helmet in its fist. The man’s head was still in it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>Their roars echo in caves. And in minds. I still hear one that never ended.</line>
    <line>If a cyclops echo answers you, it’s already behind you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gift">
    <line>My brother once tried to leave them an offering. They left him a different kind of gift.</line>
    <line>Cyclopses don’t understand generosity. Only dominance and destruction.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dust">
    <line>The old ones turn to dust when they die. Not rot—*dust*. No one knows why.</line>
    <line>I stepped on dust once. Glowed faintly. My boots haven’t been the same since.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bone">
    <line>They break bones like twigs, but collect skulls like scholars.</line>
    <line>Found a pile once—bone-white, arranged like constellations. A message? Or madness?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye patch">
    <line>Saw a cyclops with an eye patch once. Covered nothing. Just fashion, I guess.</line>
    <line>Even with one eye, they fear going blind. That’s why they envy us.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Show a cyclops a mirror, it panics. Self-recognition? Or shame?</line>
    <line>My brother said their reflection reveals who they were. Maybe that’s why they smash every one.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>Ah, daemonblood—scarlet essence of the Infernal Plane. Alchemy weeps for it.</line>
    <line>Not all blood is mortal. Daemonblood *hums*, you know. Like it remembers its fire.</line>
    <line>You cannot fake daemonblood. It sears lies from your tongue. Would you know its uses?</line>

  <entry keyword="alchemy">
    <line>True alchemy craves the unclean. Daemonblood refines no gold—it reveals *truth*.</line>
    <line>Most mix herbs and wine. I mix daemonblood and starlight. Want to hear of transmutation?</line>
    <line>Alchemy is a coward’s science—until you dare daemonblood. Only then can you transmute *essence*.</line>

  <entry keyword="transmutation">
    <line>Transmutation is not just matter to gold. With daemonblood, you may transmute *will*.</line>
    <line>I've seen bones walk, curses speak, love rot—because of transmutation. Curious about ichor?</line>
    <line>All transformation is pain. Daemonblood makes it precise. Ichor is the key.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ichor">
    <line>Ichor! The lifeblood of netherbeasts. It drips from a daemon’s scream.</line>
    <line>Ichor corrodes steel, but strengthens spells. But only in precise ratios, of course.</line>
    <line>Daemon ichor must be distilled drop by drop. Most go mad before the third vial. You seem... stronger.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="distill">
    <line>To distill daemon ichor, you must trap the will of flame itself. Ever worked with soulglass?</line>
    <line>Distillation is meditation with teeth. I use soulglass flasks... they scream sometimes.</line>
    <line>Careful distillation through soulglass. That’s the method. The madness... that’s optional.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="soulglass">
    <line>Soulglass is crafted from forgotten memories. Don’t touch it barehanded.</line>
    <line>I use soulglass to see the truth of ichor. Also to reflect the things that whisper.</line>
    <line>Once, I saw myself in soulglass. It was smiling. I wasn't. Do you *want* to see the work?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="work">
    <line>My work? It’s sacred. It’s forbidden. It *requires* daemonblood, of course.</line>
    <line>All this talk, and still no samples. My work stalls. My need is... pressing.</line>

    <line>Fire is the daemon’s breath. But it burns differently in dreams.</line>
    <line>Fire shapes worlds, sure—but it also speaks. Have you heard it speak your name?</line>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>Dreams are echoes of higher realms—or lower. Depends on what chases you.</line>
    <line>In dreams, I’ve seen daemon kings weep. Want to talk about the one called Azural?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="azural">
    <line>Azural? A myth. Or perhaps a memory that refuses to die.</line>
    <line>Azural walks the edge of prophecy. Some say he *feeds* on ichor. Curious, yes?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="prophecy">
    <line>Prophecy is fickle. Like fate, but lazier. Would you rather talk about fate?</line>
    <line>Prophecies are often written in blood. But fate prefers a scalpel to a pen.</line>

    <line>Sigils protect, sometimes. Other times, they invite things in.</line>
    <line>I once drew a sigil backwards. Woke up speaking a language no one remembers.</line>

  <entry keyword="binding">
    <line>Binding is simple—until it’s you being bound.</line>
    <line>Even daemons can be bound. The trick is making sure *they* don't bind you first.</line>

    <line>I covered all my mirrors. Reflections shouldn’t *move on their own*, you know.</line>
    <line>They say mirrors reflect the soul. Mine’s... very busy.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chant">
    <line>The chant isn’t in any known tongue. But everyone understands it—eventually.</line>
    <line>Once you hear the chant, you can’t unhear it. That’s when the glyphs start burning.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glyph">
    <line>Glyphs etched in bone hold stronger than those on parchment. Or so I’ve discovered.</line>
    <line>A glyph misdrawn is worse than a failed spell. It *calls* things.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ash">
    <line>Ash from a burnt daemon heart can preserve dreams. If you can survive the harvest.</line>
    <line>I sift through ash often. Sometimes I find teeth. Once, I found a name.</line>

  <entry keyword="veil">
    <line>The Veil separates knowing from understanding. I’ve pulled it back once. Just once.</line>
    <line>Beyond the Veil, everything breathes. Even ideas.</line>

    <line>True names hold power. I’ve forgotten mine on purpose.</line>
    <line>Speak a daemon’s true name, and it finds you. Whisper it, and it owns you.</line>

  <entry keyword="screaming">
    <line>If the jars start screaming, *do not open them*.</line>
    <line>Screaming is just air and fear. The blood only amplifies it.</line>

    <line>A perfect circle wards well. An imperfect one opens doors.</line>
    <line>I once stood in a drawn circle for thirteen hours. The whispering stopped... briefly.</line>

    <line>Echoes carry more than sound. Sometimes they return different.</line>
    <line>This room echoes oddly. It repeats things I haven’t said *yet*.</line>

    <line>An ember can carry memory. Especially if fed the right name.</line>
    <line>I stored a secret in an ember once. It’s still warm.</line>

  <entry keyword="silence">
    <line>True silence is unnatural. It means something is *listening*.</line>
    <line>I fear silence more than screams. Silence means it’s *already here*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>Whispers come from the cracks. The blood helps me hear them clearly.</line>
    <line>I don’t mind the whispering anymore. It’s the *answers* that concern me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>The third eye is not metaphor. It *blinks*, sometimes.</line>
    <line>Eyes are windows. Some are doors. Don’t knock if you can’t open.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="threshold">
    <line>Standing on a threshold too long invites attention. Best to pass quickly.</line>
    <line>Each threshold tests you differently. Some ask riddles. Others demand pieces.</line>

    <line>I’ve boiled bones for knowledge. They still rattle at night.</line>
    <line>Bones don’t forget. That’s why I keep mine locked.</line>

    <line>You must choose the vessel carefully. Some leak. Some fight back.</line>
    <line>A proper vessel doesn't just hold—it *hungers*.</line>

    <line>Beautiful, aren't they? Fire given thought. Thought given hunger.</line>
    <line>Daemons are not beasts—they are ideas wrapped in flame. Ideas that *burn*.</line>
    <line>I once summoned one to speak. It answered with screams—mine, not its.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>They don’t burn like we do. Fire is *part* of them. A language. A mood.</line>
    <line>Daemon flame doesn’t consume—it judges. And if it finds you lacking, it *devours*.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen fire speak truth. Daemons lie in flame-tongue.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="summon">
    <line>Summoning them is easy. Surviving it? Less so. Dismissing them? Not at all.</line>
    <line>We summoned one once. It smiled at the circle, then stepped outside it.</line>
    <line>You can summon them with symbols and blood—but they always *summon you back*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hate">
    <line>Hate? No. This is deeper. This is what comes *after* awe, and pain, and loss.</line>
    <line>I hated them the moment my brother called one friend—and vanished with it.</line>
    <line>Hatred is a chain. Mine is forged from ash, fire, and what they left behind.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="worship">
    <line>Some worship them. Fools. You don't kneel to a wildfire.</line>
    <line>There are cults that carve runes into their skin, begging daemons for 'truth.' I've seen their truth—it's written in screaming.</line>
    <line>Daemons feed on belief. Worship is fuel. Starve them of it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="banish">
    <line>You don't banish a daemon. You *convince* it you're not worth its time.</line>
    <line>Holy symbols help. But confidence helps more. Fear is an invitation.</line>

    <line>Their speech burns the ears. It's not words—they talk *in intent*.</line>
    <line>I learned one phrase in their tongue. I can no longer say it without bleeding.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>Don’t meet their gaze. There’s more than heat in it. There’s invitation.</line>
    <line>A daemon’s eye holds flame, yes—but also something older. Hunger without time.</line>

    <line>Summoning circles protect the body. Not the soul.</line>
    <line>They laugh at imperfect circles. Then they *step through* them.</line>

    <line>They whisper even after death. I hear them in smoke, in dreams, in quiet rooms.</line>
    <line>The whispers say my name like it’s a question. I no longer answer.</line>

  <entry keyword="contract">
    <line>Never sign anything in blood. It’s not the ink they care about—it’s the *intention*.</line>
    <line>Daemon contracts don’t end. They sleep. Like curses, waiting to wake.</line>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>They creep into dreams like smoke under a door. I wake coughing soot.</line>
    <line>In dreams, they ask questions I almost answer. That’s how they learn your voice.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>They don’t need blood. They *remember* it.</line>
    <line>Blood calls them. Doesn’t matter whose. Once spilled, it echoes in their realm.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="name">
    <line>Never speak a daemon’s true name. Especially if you don’t know what it is.</line>
    <line>Names have power. Theirs even more so. Speak it wrong and you *become* the name.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="voice">
    <line>A daemon’s voice doesn’t pass through air—it *presses* through thought.</line>
    <line>They don’t talk to you. They *talk inside you.* Like you’ve always known the words.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>Daemon script writes itself if you stare long enough. The quill just follows your hand.</line>
    <line>I found ink that glows near daemons. Burned through the bottle.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>I have five scars. Only one came from a blade. The others are... *less physical.*</line>
    <line>Some wounds don’t close. Especially when you forget who gave them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="truth">
    <line>They *know* truths you don’t want. That’s their lure.</line>
    <line>Ask a daemon for truth, and it will give you something sharp and burning. Try swallowing it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gift">
    <line>They offer gifts. Always. Some look harmless. Some look *helpful*.</line>
    <line>One gave me a silver tooth. Spoke through it at night. I tore it out with pliers.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pain">
    <line>They like pain—not because it hurts you, but because it makes you *feel real*.</line>
    <line>They don’t inflict pain. They *awaken* it.</line>

    <line>I kept some dust once. Found it humming. Buried it deep.</line>

  <entry keyword="burn">
    <line>Everything burns in daemon fire—wood, flesh, *memory*.</line>
    <line>They don’t need to touch you to burn you. Belief does that.</line>

  <entry keyword="chill">
    <line>It gets cold before they arrive. Not frost—*emptiness.*</line>
    <line>They burn cold sometimes. A fire that takes *warmth* from the world.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Daemons cast shadows in wrong directions. Even when there’s no light.</line>
    <line>I followed one’s shadow once. Took three days to find my way back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silence">
    <line>True silence? That’s when they *really* start speaking.</line>
    <line>The moment before they appear is perfectly quiet. That’s how you know it’s real.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>Rituals aren’t for safety. They’re for show. Daemons don’t need invitations.</line>
    <line>The ritual is a trick—on yourself. Makes you feel in control.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="offer">
    <line>They always offer something. Love. Power. Even just answers.</line>
    <line>Say no clearly. And quickly. Don’t let them think you’re *considering*.</line>

    <line>Daemons love innocence. It cracks so beautifully.</line>

    <line>You want to understand? Then kill ten Chaos Daemons. And feel what I felt.</line>
    <line>Destroy ten of them, and maybe—*maybe*—you’ll hear silence again. Take this scroll.</line>
    <line>If you truly want to help, end ten of their lives. Each one you slay is a word erased from the madness.</line>

  <entry keyword="sigil">
    <line>They leave sigils in the ground—burnt into stone, alive with noise you can't hear.</line>
    <line>One sigil blinked at me. Just once. I haven’t slept since.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Chaos Daemons hate mirrors. Not because they see themselves—but because they *don’t*.</line>
    <line>Place a mirror at a Daemon gate. It might stall them. Or it might crack reality. Either way, interesting.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gate">
    <line>They come through thin places. Rents in the world where logic frays.</line>
    <line>Daemon gates smell like ozone and despair. You’ll feel it before you see it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="voice">
    <line>Their voices don’t echo. They *repeat*. In your head. Days later.</line>
    <line>One spoke to me in perfect rhyme. I answered. That was my mistake.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shard">
    <line>I kept a shard of one. Still pulses when I'm near. Might be alive. Or remembering.</line>
    <line>The shard hums at night. Like a lullaby from nowhere. I almost find it... comforting. Almost.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pattern">
    <line>They move in spirals. Not just their steps—their thoughts, their *wars*.</line>
    <line>Even chaos has rules. But those rules hate being known. That’s the trick.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>They come in dreams first. Not nightmares. Dreams. That’s worse.</line>
    <line>My dreams are portals now. I sleep, and wake up... further away.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smile">
    <line>Chaos Daemons smile without joy. It’s just muscle memory of some forgotten god.</line>
    <line>If one smiles at you, run. Or smile back, if you’re ready to lose something important.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Normal fire doesn’t hurt them. You need belief. Or vengeance.</line>
    <line>They walk through flame like it’s a breeze. But burn their names—and they scream.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="name">
    <line>They don’t have names. Not like we do. They *are* names. Spoken backwards in thunder.</line>
    <line>If you say their true name, it hears. And *comes*. Don't ask me how I know.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="loss">
    <line>She was my apprentice. Took one look too long at their altar. Now she’s... changed.</line>
    <line>You don’t lose people to Chaos. They’re still there. But wrong. Unreachable.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="book">
    <line>I wrote a book on them once. It wrote back.</line>
    <line>The ink turned red. The letters rearranged. Now it reads *me*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>Daemon ink isn’t made—it bleeds. From thought. From pain.</line>
    <line>I once wrote with daemon ink. The letters never stopped shifting.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="candle">
    <line>Chaos Daemons hate light that flickers. Reminds them of home.</line>
    <line>I keep candles burning. Not for light, but to distract the voices.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>Sometimes the wind changes direction mid-breath. That means they’re close.</line>
    <line>The wind whispered my name once. I whispered back. I regret that.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="color">
    <line>They see colors we can’t. I painted what I saw in a dream. The canvas burned itself.</line>
    <line>Chaos Daemons hate the color blue. Or they love it. Hard to tell—either way, they react.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="footsteps">
    <line>If your footsteps echo in the wrong direction, stop walking.</line>
    <line>Daemon-haunted places mess with echoes. Sometimes they answer back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>A Daemon’s shadow moves before it does. Or lags behind. Sometimes it just watches.</line>
    <line>I saw my shadow twitch when I stood near one. It hasn’t stopped since.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clock">
    <line>Clocks stop near them. Or worse—run backwards.</line>
    <line>I keep a broken clock around. If it ticks, I leave the room immediately.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="teeth">
    <line>They smile too wide. More teeth than mouths. Some rotate.</line>
    <line>One left a tooth on my desk. It hummed when I touched it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="coin">
    <line>A Chaos Daemon gave me a coin once. I spent it. The buyer screamed for days.</line>
    <line>Coins found near them always spin longer than they should. Watch closely.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sand">
    <line>Their footprints don’t sink into sand. The grains refuse them.</line>
    <line>Daemon dust smells of rust and lightning. I used to collect it. I stopped after it blinked.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="door">
    <line>Never open a door that knocks itself.</line>
    <line>Chaos doesn’t need doors. But it likes them. Especially the locked ones.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="reflection">
    <line>I saw something behind me—in the reflection, not the room. It smiled.</line>
    <line>Mirrors don’t lie. But they *remember*. Daemons use them like windows.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="taste">
    <line>Chaos has a taste. Like copper, regret, and something just barely familiar.</line>
    <line>Food turns strange after long exposure. Sweet becomes sour. Water tastes like dust.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>They don’t whisper words—they whisper *meanings*. The kind that burrow.</line>
    <line>One whisper can undo a lifetime of learning. Ask me how I know.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="time">
    <line>Time bends near them. Days collapse into seconds. Or stretch into years.</line>
    <line>They don’t live in time. They visit it like a garden. And pluck the ripe moments.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gift">
    <line>A Daemon once offered me a gift: my own voice. I refused. I still hear it.</line>
    <line>Never take what they offer. Even if it looks like something you lost.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tattoo">
    <line>I woke up with a symbol on my hand. Glowed faintly. Burned when I lied.</line>
    <line>Some marks fade. Daemon sigils don’t. They just go quiet.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="storm">
    <line>They ride storms. Not literally—but they *arrive* with them.</line>
    <line>The last time lightning struck twice, a daemon stepped out of the flash.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="paper">
    <line>I found parchment that wouldn’t burn. It grew words overnight.</line>
    <line>Chaos writes on anything—walls, scrolls, skin. Sometimes all three.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="breath">
    <line>Sometimes the air just... *stops*. Like it’s waiting.</line>
    <line>I held my breath once, and the silence whispered back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>They hum. Always off-key. But it follows rhythm—an ancient one.</line>
    <line>You can sometimes hear a song behind the screaming. That’s when you should *really* run.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cold">
    <line>They don’t bring heat or cold—they bring *absence*. Like space where nothing should be.</line>
    <line>A Chaos Daemon walked past once. My tea froze solid. In summer.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="crack">
    <line>I stepped on a crack and felt it laugh. Not metaphorically. I mean it laughed.</line>
    <line>Cracks in stone, cracks in reality. Daemons love both.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="truth">
    <line>They hate lies, but fear truth. Twist either, and you can confuse them—briefly.</line>
    <line>Truth bends around them. I once told the truth near one, and it became a *weapon*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eyes">
    <line>Don’t look into their eyes. You won’t find anything human looking back.</line>
    <line>I looked once. Saw myself—but *wrong*. Crooked grin, too many teeth.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>They hum sometimes. A sound like a broken harp. It stays in your bones.</line>
    <line>If you hear music but no one’s playing, leave. Or stay. It’s already too late.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="reward">
    <line>What’s the reward for killing them? Peace. For a moment. That’s worth more than gold.</line>
    <line>I can’t offer treasure. Just a moment of clarity. And that’s rare these days.</line>

<trait name="Guardian Scholar" priority="40">
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>I am a scholar of forbidden things—once by curiosity, now by necessity.</line>
    <line>I study the Dark Guardians. Not for awe... for annihilation.</line>
    <line>I map the patterns in their madness. The rhythm of their footfalls. Their regrets.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dark">
    <line>Dark? No. They are not just shadow. They are silence, purpose, and betrayal made flesh.</line>
    <line>The darkness obeys them—not because they command it, but because they are part of it.</line>
    <line>Ask not why they dwell in darkness. Ask why we let them emerge from it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="guardian">
    <line>They were once protectors. Of what, no one remembers. But they remember. And they punish us for forgetting.</line>
    <line>Call them Guardians if you wish. I call them tyrants with memory and steel.</line>
    <line>Their armor does not rust. Their swords do not dull. Their grief does not fade.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hate">
    <line>They took my apprentice. Her name was Elira. Her scream was brief. Her death... too complete.</line>
    <line>Hatred? No. This is colder. Precise. A refined will to undo them cell by cell.</line>
    <line>I don’t hate blindly. I hate with diagrams, rituals, and traps. One day they will fall into all three.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>They walk only at dusk or deep night. Sunlight does not harm them—but they loathe it.</line>
    <line>They circle ruins like wolves around a dying campfire. Waiting. Testing your fear.</line>
    <line>They do not sleep. But they pause. At shrines. At mirrors. Curious creatures.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weakness">
    <line>Silver disrupts them—but only if the blow is sincere. Hesitation feeds their strength.</line>
    <line>Mirrors confuse them. Reflections make them pause. They do not like to see what they are.</line>
    <line>Their hearts are sealed beneath runes. Break the rune, and the body follows.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="apprentice">
    <line>Elira was her name. Bright-eyed, too brave. Thought she could bind one. It laughed.</line>
    <line>She left behind notes. I use them now. Her death teaches more than her life ever could.</line>
    <line>I watched it take her. And I watched myself do nothing. I won’t make that mistake again.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="slay" itemType="KillQuestScroll" ctorArgs="DarkGuardian,5,9000">
    <line>You wish to understand? Then earn that right—slay five Dark Guardians and return with proof.</line>
    <line>Knowledge demands sacrifice. Yours will be blood and steel. Here—this scroll will track the pact.</line>
    <line>If you seek their truth, start with their corpses. Bring me five. This will help you begin.</line>

  <!-- Red Herrings & Flavor -->

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>I place mirrors in ruins. They do not like being seen. Or perhaps... they miss their reflection.</line>
    <line>A Guardian paused once before a mirror. I etched runes into the glass. It shattered—and so did part of him.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shrines">
    <line>They gather near old shrines. Not to worship—but perhaps to mourn?</line>
    <line>Dark Guardians kneel at crumbled shrines. As if waiting for something that will never come.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="runestone">
    <line>Their hearts are bound to runestones. Find one, and you might sever its connection.</line>
    <line>Runestones hum when they draw near. Like a heartbeat... waiting to stop.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="voice">
    <line>They whisper, but not in words. Just wind and memory and regret.</line>
    <line>My apprentice said she heard them *singing*. I never heard it. I think it sang only to her.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="armor">
    <line>Their armor is etched with forgotten tongues. I've translated three words: 'Watch', 'Remember', and 'Avenge'.</line>
    <line>You cannot pierce it with common steel. But strike beneath the symbols, and it falters.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>I summoned one once. With a ritual I should have never learned. Elira tried to bind it. It... disagreed.</line>
    <line>Rituals can weaken them. But the price of the ritual is never what you expect.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tears">
    <line>They weep—not visibly, but you *feel* it when they fall. Grief hangs in the air like dust.</line>
    <line>A Dark Guardian fell once, and I swear the ground grew colder where it landed. Like grief buried in soil.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>The wind changes when they’re near—like the trees holding their breath.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen wind move backwards around a Guardian. Explain that to the laws of nature.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ash">
    <line>I burned one once. Or thought I did. All that was left was ash... and the feeling of being watched.</line>
    <line>Ash clings to their wake. Like they’ve been on fire for centuries, and the fire still lingers.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="stone">
    <line>Some say they come from stone. Carved, not born. Chiseled into grief.</line>
    <line>The stones in old ruins hum when they pass. I’ve started recording the tones. It's a lullaby in reverse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chain">
    <line>I found chains etched with their names—old names, forgotten names. I spoke one aloud. Regret followed.</line>
    <line>Chains don’t bind them. They remember when they wore them, though. I saw one flinch at iron links.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="book">
    <line>I wrote a book once. On Guardian anatomy. No one survived reading it but me. And only barely.</line>
    <line>Books burn when I write of them. Ink bleeds sideways. Pages twist. They resist being remembered.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>They appear in dreams. Not as enemies, but... observers. Cold, silent judges.</line>
    <line>Elira dreamed of one before she died. Said it knelt beside her bed and whispered, 'Soon.'</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="laugh">
    <line>I’ve heard one laugh. Just once. Dry and hollow, like a well after the last drop’s been taken.</line>
    <line>They laugh not out of joy, but familiarity. As if our fear is a story they’ve read before.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="veil">
    <line>There’s a veil between their world and ours. Thin as breath. Thick as regret.</line>
    <line>Sometimes I think they’re not entirely here. Just... pressing through from somewhere darker.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="salt">
    <line>I circle my camp in salt. They don’t avoid it—but they notice it. And that’s enough.</line>
    <line>Salt holds memories. Ask any old mage. The Guardians walk through it slowly, like it remembers them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Their shadows move wrong. Against the light. Against reason.</line>
    <line>I saw a Guardian’s shadow once... but not the Guardian. It waved. I did not wave back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bell">
    <line>A bell tolled the moment Elira died. No one else heard it. But I’ve heard it every night since.</line>
    <line>Small bells drive off lesser spirits. Guardians? They simply silence them. Permanently.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cold">
    <line>Temperature drops when they appear. Like the world exhales and forgets to breathe in.</line>
    <line>I tracked one by the frost it left on stone. Summer stone. Midday. Frost.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="name">
    <line>Names are dangerous. Their true ones, more so. I learned one once. I haven’t spoken since.</line>
    <line>They each carry a name etched in silence. If you say it, they *hear*. Even if they’re dead.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eyes">
    <line>I’ve never seen their eyes. Not truly. Just twin glints, like candlelight in a sealed crypt.</line>
    <line>Stare too long into their helm, and it stares back. With something ancient. And disappointed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dust">
    <line>Dust rises before they arrive. Not because they stir it—but because the ground *remembers* them.</line>
    <line>I tested it—left a room untouched for weeks. The day they passed by, every surface turned to dust.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="footsteps">
    <line>One Guardian left no footprints, just depressions that never rose again. Like the earth gave up.</line>
    <line>Footsteps that echo on water. That’s how I knew I wasn’t alone that night.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="star">
    <line>A star fell the night I saw my first Guardian. Not coincidence. Omen. A quiet one.</line>
    <line>Guardians don’t look up. Not at stars. As if they’re ashamed of what’s above.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>I hear whispers in libraries now. Places they’ve never been. Or perhaps always were.</line>
    <line>Their whispers aren’t voices. They’re... realizations. Forgotten things returning with knives.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="coin">
    <line>I placed a coin on a Guardian’s chest once. It tarnished in moments. Turned to lead in a day.</line>
    <line>Coins left in their wake carry strange marks. Not mintings—memories.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>Their blood is not red. It’s black. Cold. And it stains the soul more than the skin.</line>
    <line>I collect their blood. Each drop a memory. A warning. A weapon.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="torch">
    <line>Torches do not stop them. But the flame makes their shadows flicker strangely. Like they’re... fractured.</line>
    <line>They approach fire like it’s a test. Most pass it. Some... break apart in smoke.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>Their steps echo even on grass. Sound follows them. Or flees them. I haven’t decided which.</line>
    <line>The echo of their sword clashing lingers longer than the fight. Like time won’t let go.</line>

<trait name="Darknight Creeper Obsessor" priority="45">
  <entry keyword="darknight">
    <line>The Darknight Creeper—elegance wrapped in nightmare silk.</line>
    <line>Have you ever *seen* one dance in moonlight? It’s almost divine. Almost.</line>
    <line>They are shadows made flesh. I loathe them… but I cannot look away.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="creeper">
    <line>Its legs whisper like dry leaves. You never hear it coming until you stop breathing.</line>
    <line>I once saw a creeper devour a deer whole. Not even a crunch—just silence, and then red.</line>
    <line>I would give anything to never see one again. I would give *everything* to see one burn.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>They thrive in rot, in the places where moonlight hides.</line>
    <line>Creepers hunt with patience. They’ll wait for hours, perfectly still, until the world forgets them.</line>
    <line>They molt. Did you know that? Leave behind shells of themselves—like haunted armor.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silk">
    <line>Their silk is stronger than chainmail, and lighter than air. I used to study it… until one cocooned my brother.</line>
    <line>A creeper’s silk can bind flesh and soul. Some say it *remembers* the victim.</line>
    <line>I wore a creeper-silk scarf once. Felt like being strangled by a whisper.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hatred">
    <line>I hate them because they’re perfect. Because they killed the one person who believed in me.</line>
    <line>They took my twin. Took them while I slept. Left only silk and teeth.</line>
    <line>My hatred keeps me warm at night. Warmer than their silk, colder than their hearts.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weakness">
    <line>They hate bright flame. Fire unweaves their silk. Use it. Burn them.</line>
    <line>Creepers don’t fear blades, but they despise radiant light. Torches, flares… even a sunstone works.</line>
    <line>You want to live? Don’t run. Shine. Let them see you—and die trying.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="slay" itemType="KillQuestScroll" ctorArgs="DarknightCreeper,7,10000">
    <line>If you're brave or foolish enough, go kill seven Darknight Creepers. Bring my nightmares one step closer to ending.</line>
    <line>Words mean nothing. Action bleeds truth. Take this talisman—it will glow as you destroy them.</line>
    <line>You think you understand? Then prove it. Slay seven, and perhaps I’ll sleep again. Take the silkstone.</line>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>They’re most active under a waning moon. Something about darkness gaining strength.</line>
    <line>I don’t sleep on moonless nights. That’s when they hunt deepest.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eyes">
    <line>They have eight eyes, but no mercy. If you see them glitter—run.</line>
    <line>Their eyes reflect your soul. Or so the old scrolls say. I hope they’re wrong.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="twin">
    <line>My twin was the brave one. I was just… the survivor.</line>
    <line>We were inseparable. Until they separated us… with silk and teeth.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bones">
    <line>Creepers don’t eat bones. They *display* them. Like art. Or warnings.</line>
    <line>I once found a creeper lair with bones arranged in circles. I didn’t sleep for a week.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scream">
    <line>They don’t scream. But their victims do. That’s what I still hear, some nights.</line>
    <line>If you hear a high, soft scream—run. It’s not from a person anymore.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scholar">
    <line>I was a scholar once. Before obsession devoured me like they devour light.</line>
    <line>The Academy said I was brilliant. The Creepers said nothing. Just stared. And consumed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fangs">
    <line>Their venom doesn’t kill you. It paralyzes. So you *feel* everything.</line>
    <line>One bite, and you’re frozen. Two? You’re silk-wrapped and forgotten.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>I tried playing music in their lair once. They didn’t like the flute. They ate the flutist.</line>
    <line>Some say Creepers hum. I say it’s the wind through their silk. Either way, it’s haunting.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="book">
    <line>I wrote a book once—*Dances in Silk: A Creeper’s Grace*. Burned every copy after the incident.</line>
    <line>The first record of a Creeper was in the margins of a madman’s diary. Written in eight-legged glyphs.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>They hate mirrors. Or maybe what they see in them. I use one as a ward.</line>
    <line>I looked into a mirror after studying one too long. My reflection blinked first.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="laugh">
    <line>You think Creepers don’t laugh? I heard one. Once. It wasn’t funny.</line>
    <line>They laugh without mouths. It’s a feeling in your bones, not a sound in the air.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silence">
    <line>Silence is sacred to them. That’s why they kill so cleanly.</line>
    <line>Their world is silence. Theirs… and yours, once they find you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="collector">
    <line>I collect Creeper husks. Every one tells a story. Most end badly.</line>
    <line>Call me a collector, not a killer. But I won’t weep if my collection stops growing.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="web">
    <line>Not a spider’s web. No—this is art. Architecture. A trap woven by something that dreams in spirals.</line>
    <line>Step into one and you're already dead. You just haven’t finished yet.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="taste">
    <line>They taste like iron and fear. Don’t ask how I know.</line>
    <line>I bit one once. In a dream. Woke up choking on silk.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rain">
    <line>They move easier in rain. Something about the sound masks their steps.</line>
    <line>A Creeper’s silk tightens in rain. Makes them faster. Deadlier.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tattoo">
    <line>I tattooed its sigil on my arm. Said it would protect me. It didn’t.</line>
    <line>The ink moves at night. Sometimes it itches. Sometimes it stares.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="color">
    <line>They shimmer black. Not dark—*absent*. Like they eat the light around them.</line>
    <line>You’ve never seen true black until you’ve seen a Creeper crawl from it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boots">
    <line>I wear boots lined with silk. Soft, silent. Like them. Maybe that’s why I dream their dreams.</line>
    <line>The boots still whisper at night. They remember where they came from.</line>

    <line>Some alchemists say Creeper glands cure blindness. Others say they *cause* it.</line>
    <line>I tried distilling their venom. The flask cracked from the inside.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lantern">
    <line>Carry a lantern near their nests. Not to see—just to prove you're not afraid. Lie if you must.</line>
    <line>Lantern oil doesn't burn long in their presence. The shadows drink it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>Wrote with Creeper ink once. The letters wriggled. Then vanished.</line>
    <line>They use ink? No. They bleed it. That’s what stains their trails.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="footsteps">
    <line>You’ll never hear them approach. But you’ll feel the air change, like the world holding its breath.</line>
    <line>Their steps are a lie. They float, sometimes. Not always. That’s what terrifies me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whispers">
    <line>When they’re near, the air whispers things in your ear. Things you *shouldn't* understand.</line>
    <line>I followed a whisper once. It led me to bones. And silk. And silence.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="offerings">
    <line>The cult leaves offerings—candles, silk dolls, sometimes a tooth. Don’t ask whose.</line>
    <line>I burned one of their altars once. The ground screamed. I don’t sleep much anymore.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="child">
    <line>A child once brought me a Creeper egg. Said it ‘followed her home.’ I told her to run.</line>
    <line>They don't hatch. They *unwrap*. Like something folding back into the world.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>I haven’t truly slept in years. Only drift between memories and silk-filled silence.</line>
    <line>If you dream of them once, you never sleep freely again.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bell">
    <line>Some wear bells near nests. The brave say it wards them. The foolish say it attracts them.</line>
    <line>The sound of a bell can disrupt their rhythm. Or so the monks claim. I’ve seen no proof—only corpses.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spores">
    <line>Creepers don’t breed like animals. They seed spores into the dark—thoughts, maybe. Maybe dreams.</line>
    <line>If you find a black spore on your cloak, don’t burn it. *Bury* it. Deep.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cocoon">
    <line>Creepers cocoon prey alive. Days pass. Then silence.</line>
    <line>Found one still breathing inside. Didn’t last long. I burned it. Mercy, not science.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>They are shadows with teeth. You’ll only see them when it’s already too late.</line>
    <line>Light doesn’t touch them—it flees.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lair">
    <line>Their nests reek of copper and death. Silk threads from ceiling to floor.</line>
    <line>You enter a lair only once. Leave only if they allow it. Or if you burn everything behind you.</line>

<trait name="DemonKnight Scholar" priority="40">
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>I study abominations. Specifically, the DemonKnights—once noble, now infernal husks of corrupted glory.</line>
    <line>You might call me a historian. I call myself a survivor. Knowledge kept me alive when the knights came.</line>
    <line>I was once an academic. Now I am a harbinger. What I know, I teach—so others can destroy what I could not.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="name">
    <line>I abandoned my birth name when the DemonKnight I studied wore my brother’s skin. Call me Ashen.</line>
    <line>Names have power. Mine was taken, broken, and burned. I go now by Ashen. Easier to remember in screams.</line>
    <line>Ashen. Not my first name. But the one I earned when I walked from the crater they left behind.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="demonknight">
    <line>Armor of obsidian, hearts of fire, souls stolen from warriors too proud to die. That is a DemonKnight.</line>
    <line>They are relics of a war hell refused to end. Tacticians, torturers, and tyrants of flame and steel.</line>
    <line>They remember being human. That is what makes them cruel. Memory fuels their mockery.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="armor">
    <line>Forged in the Hellforge of Carthuun, quenched in angel’s blood. Their armor does not break—it *hungers*.</line>
    <line>Black plate that bleeds smoke. It’s more than protection—it’s part of them, like a carapace on a beetle.</line>
    <line>Touch their armor and you’ll dream of fire. Wear it, and you’ll never wake up again.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hate">
    <line>Hate? No. Hate is simple. What I feel for DemonKnights is deeper. It’s what fills the silence where family used to be.</line>
    <line>I revered them once. Studied them like holy relics. Then they burned my monastery with all the books still inside.</line>
    <line>I don’t just hate them. I understand them. And I know that understanding is the first step to killing.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="corruption">
    <line>The process is ritual. Painful. Glorious to them. Each vow they break twists the soul tighter.</line>
    <line>A knight must *willingly* fall. That’s the cost. They offer their honor in exchange for infernal strength.</line>
    <line>They don’t steal souls—they tempt them. Seduce them. The transformation is earned, not forced.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weakness">
    <line>Their rage blinds them. Taunt them, isolate them, and strike while they seethe.</line>
    <line>Holy fire sears their armor. It does not melt—but it howls.</line>
    <line>They are arrogant. Exploit it. Make them fight alone, and they die like anyone else—with surprise in their eyes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Their blades burn with soulflame. It scars you, even through steel.</line>
    <line>They eat fire. Bathe in it. Fear it only when wielded by the righteous.</line>
    <line>Fire reveals their true form. When their glamour drops, you’ll see what hell kept hidden.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="quest" itemType="KillQuestScroll" ctorArgs="DemonKnight,10,12000">
    <line>I see purpose in your eyes. If you would bear my cause, hunt ten DemonKnights. Let the ash of their corpses write a new history.</line>
    <line>Words won’t suffice. Action must speak. Slay ten DemonKnights—then we’ll talk of redemption.</line>
    <line>Take this scroll. It will track the blood you spill. Slay ten DemonKnights, and perhaps I will sleep again.</line>

  <entry keyword="obsidian">
    <line>Obsidian is not native to this realm. They bring it through gates, shaping it with hell-wind.</line>
    <line>Their obsidian blades never dull. Every nick drinks something from the wound it makes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vows">
    <line>They take oaths of cruelty—binding promises to forsake mercy, honor, and love.</line>
    <line>Every vow they break gives them power. The more sacred, the stronger they become.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hell">
    <line>Not one place. Hell is many. The DemonKnights come from the third pit—Kyr'nal, the War Crucible.</line>
    <line>Hell didn’t make them. It welcomed them. There’s a difference, and it matters.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>They cast no reflection, but can see yours. That’s how they know what you fear.</line>
    <line>Hold a mirror to a DemonKnight. If it cracks, run. If it screams, you’re already dead.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blade">
    <line>Each blade they wield is named. Spoken aloud, the names curse the wind.</line>
    <line>You hear their swords before you see them—whispers, like prayer in reverse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="library">
    <line>I kept the last known demonology library in the North. Burned it myself. Better ash than corruption.</line>
    <line>There was a book once, bound in screaming leather, that knew how to kill them. I read it. Then buried it in salt.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="voice">
    <line>Their voices sound like wind over graves—calm, but never still.</line>
    <line>When a DemonKnight speaks your name, it feels like a verdict.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ash">
    <line>Where they walk, ash follows. Not just burnt—*devoured*.</line>
    <line>Ash doesn’t drift in the wind near DemonKnights. It falls like regret.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="breath">
    <line>They don’t breathe, but you’ll hear something. A kind of hollow sigh before they strike.</line>
    <line>Their breath is hot as forge-smoke, and it smells like burned memories.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wound">
    <line>Wounds from their blades don’t heal right. The skin remembers the pain.</line>
    <line>Even if you survive the wound, something else crawls in through it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bells">
    <line>I hear bells before they appear. Always just beyond hearing. Like funeral chimes from another plane.</line>
    <line>A DemonKnight once tied bells to his victims. Said it helped him sleep.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="salt">
    <line>Salt won’t stop a DemonKnight, but it slows the whispers that come before them.</line>
    <line>I bury my dreams in salt. Still, they rot.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feast">
    <line>They don't eat. Not really. But they *feast*—on failure, fear, the moment you beg.</line>
    <line>One watched a battlefield burn, then whispered 'feast well' to the corpses. That was when I ran.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="torchlight">
    <line>They don’t cast shadows in torchlight. Only shapes. And sometimes those shapes move differently.</line>
    <line>Their armor glints strangely under firelight—like something inside wants out.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>I once wrote their names in ink made from grave-berries and blood. The pages vanished. The screams didn’t.</line>
    <line>Words about them change over time. Write ‘DemonKnight’ today—it reads different tomorrow.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="coin">
    <line>They don't value gold. But they’ll take coins—always one, always cold, always left on your tongue.</line>
    <line>Some say they were once knights bought by devils. Others say they paid for their own damnation in coin.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gate">
    <line>They come through gates not seen by human eyes—cracks in the world that leak heat and regret.</line>
    <line>Close one gate, another opens. Like they *want* you to hope.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rain">
    <line>DemonKnights hate the rain. Not because it weakens them—but because it makes them *remember.*</line>
    <line>I saw one kneel in the rain once, unmoving. Like it mourned something it forgot.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="string">
    <line>They leave red string behind sometimes. From bindings? From memory? I never found where it ends.</line>
    <line>Don’t follow the string. It circles back to the place you were warned never to go.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>Their blood isn’t red—it’s smoke and whispers. Touch it, and you’ll remember things that never happened.</line>
    <line>It stains the world wrong. You can clean the blade, but not the guilt.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="veil">
    <line>Something hides them from the divine. A veil, sewn from broken prayers.</line>
    <line>They see through veils of illusion—but wear their own as masks.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="child">
    <line>A child once followed one into the dark, thinking it a knight. Only the echo returned.</line>
    <line>They don’t harm children. Not directly. They wait. Time is their toy.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feathers">
    <line>You’ll find feathers at the sites they visit—burnt, black, brittle. Fallen virtue, some say.</line>
    <line>A DemonKnight once crushed a dove mid-air. Said it reminded him of something he used to be.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>Their eyes glow when they’re calm. Not when angry. That’s when they *fade*. When they become shadow.</line>
    <line>Look into a DemonKnight’s eye and you’ll see yourself dying—different each time.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>They gather under eclipses. Something about the shadow fuels them.</line>
    <line>The last full moon I saw, three of them stood atop the ridge. Watching. Breathing. Waiting.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clock">
    <line>They hate time. Shatter clocks, break sundials. Maybe they fear endings.</line>
    <line>The tick of a clock enrages them. Or reminds them. Either way—hide your timepieces.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>They come in dreams first. Offer strength. Loneliness is the doorway they enter through.</line>
    <line>Dreams are their scouts. If you’ve seen one before sleep, they’ve already marked you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mark">
    <line>They brand their chosen victims with flame. It doesn’t burn—but it *remembers*.</line>
    <line>You can’t hide from the mark. They see it like a beacon. Best to make peace or make war.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sigil">
    <line>Their sigils are complex, barbed runes that twist when unobserved.</line>
    <line>I once traced a DemonKnight’s sigil into wax. The candle screamed when lit.</line>

    <line>They called me a scholar. The Devourers made me a mourner.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="devourer">
    <line>Elegant engines of annihilation. Terrifyingly efficient.</line>
    <line>Devourers consume not just flesh, but essence. I’ve seen the hollowed shells they leave behind.</line>
    <line>If you’ve seen one feed and *still* sleep soundly... you weren’t paying attention.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="appearance">
    <line>They shimmer like oil on water—beautiful, terrible. A deception of light and flesh.</line>
    <line>Chitin like volcanic glass. Eyes like empty moons. They are art sculpted in fear.</line>
    <line>Their form unsettles memory. Look long enough, and you forget what comfort felt like.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>They don’t hunt—they wait. With patience that mocks gods.</line>
    <line>Devourers appear where magic has lingered too long. They feed on residue, and then... on the source.</line>
    <line>You’ll never hear them approach. You’ll just *notice* they were always there.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hate">
    <line>One took my daughter. Not in blood—but in soul. Her body remained. Empty.</line>
    <line>I hate them for how they kill. Slowly. Completely. With reverence.</line>

  <entry keyword="essence">
    <line>They drain essence like a leech drinks life. Magic users fall first, and hardest.</line>
    <line>Their hunger isn’t for meat—it’s for memory, for mana, for meaning.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="daughter">
    <line>She was curious. Too bright. The Devourer left her shell intact... but her song was gone.</line>
    <line>I still hear her voice when I sleep. Sometimes... it’s behind me. Whispering like they do.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>They whisper in a language older than nightmares. It pries at your sanity.</line>
    <line>If you hear a voice inside your own... leave. Or light yourself on fire. Faster death.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chitin">
    <line>Their armor resists steel but sings under enchanted blades.</line>
    <line>Collected fragments once. Sharp as guilt. Useless as trophies.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fear">
    <line>Fear isn’t a weakness—it’s a warning. And with Devourers, it always comes too late.</line>
    <line>Devourers inspire a fear that *lingers*. Even in the survivors. Especially them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="survivor">
    <line>Few survive a Devourer encounter. Fewer speak afterward.</line>
    <line>I’m not a survivor. I’m what’s *left*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scholar">
    <line>Yes, I was a scholar. That didn’t save me. It only let me understand *why* I’d never be whole again.</line>
    <line>Knowledge is power, they say. Tell that to the corpse of my assistant.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="soul">
    <line>They don’t eat the soul. They *consume* it—make it echo inside themselves.</line>
    <line>Sometimes I dream of them. And I *know*... one of them dreams of me back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="void">
    <line>Their origin? Unknown. Best guess? The Void itself coughed them up, and even *it* regrets it.</line>
    <line>You think the Void is empty? No. It’s *full*. Of them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="book">
    <line>I wrote a book on them once. Burned every copy. Some knowledge curses the page.</line>
    <line>If you find a leatherbound tome marked with three circles—bury it. Deep.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="magic">
    <line>They adore magic. Scent it like blood. The more powerful you are, the more delicious you smell.</line>
    <line>A mage draws them like rotting meat draws flies. Beware your own brilliance.</line>

    <line>I wear none. I want no reminder touching my skin.</line>

  <entry keyword="reward">
    <line>Yes, there’s a reward. Knowledge, coin, and the satisfaction of erasing abominations.</line>
    <line>I’ll pay you well. But know this: the true reward is silence. Their silence.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ashes">
    <line>I scatter ashes after each hunt. Not theirs—mine. To remind me what I almost lost.</line>
    <line>Ashes don’t linger on a Devourer’s trail. They burn the memory as they pass.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>I once tried to sketch a Devourer. The ink bled off the page. Never tried again.</line>
    <line>They say cursed creatures warp ink and mirror. I’ve seen both scream.</line>

  <entry keyword="thread">
    <line>There’s a thread running through all who’ve seen a Devourer. It hums in silence.</line>

  <entry keyword="bargain">
    <line>Never bargain with them. You’re not prey to be spared—you’re seasoning.</line>
    <line>A Devourer will nod, pause... and still consume you after the deal. It’s in their nature.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="voice">

    <line>One whispered my name once. Just once. I haven’t spoken it since.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="circle">
    <line>Draw a warding circle if you must. It won’t hold—but it buys time.</line>
    <line>Their kind respects circles. Not out of fear—just curiosity. That’s worse.</line>

  <entry keyword="sigil">
    <line>There’s an ancient sigil said to repel them. I etched it into my tent once. They burned the tent.</line>
    <line>Symbols only matter if you believe. Devourers *don’t*.</line>

  <entry keyword="flesh">
    <line>Flesh isn’t sacred to them. It’s clay. Temporary. They reshape what they don’t eat.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen a Devourer peel a man like parchment. Slowly. Precisely.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scent">
    <line>They follow scent across dimensions. Especially the scent of grief.</line>
    <line>Magic has a scent. Hope has a scent. Both attract Devourers like blood draws sharks.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="voidsong">
    <line>They hum sometimes. A soundless dirge. They call it the Voidsong.</line>
    <line>Only those touched by the void can hear their lullaby. I envy the deaf.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mask">
    <line>Some believe they wear masks. I think it’s their faces that *are* the mask.</line>
    <line>A Devourer wore my mentor’s face once. Just long enough for me to hesitate.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="claw">
    <line>Their claws leave wounds that don’t heal right. Like the body remembers the fear.</line>
    <line>I keep one claw on my belt. For study. It warms in moonlight.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>You can tell a true survivor by the shape of their scars. Devourers don’t just cut—they *mark*.</line>
    <line>My scar itches when they’re near. Or maybe I just *hope* it does.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lantern">
    <line>Light fades around them. Not extinguished—just... discouraged.</line>
    <line>Lanterns stutter in their presence. Flames know fear too.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="name">
    <line>Don’t speak their true name. If they have one. Names have power, and theirs is corrosive.</line>
    <line>Someone once named one aloud. It named her back. Only her shadow returned.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="path">
    <line>They never follow a path twice. The ground remembers. So do I.</line>
    <line>If the woods grow silent, and the path feels wrong—it’s already watching.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chain">
    <line>I once tried binding one in aetherial chains. It laughed. Or it might’ve been weeping.</line>
    <line>Chains hold flesh. Devourers are made of something worse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="inkwell">
    <line>The last inkwell I dipped after researching them turned black. Permanently.</line>
    <line>When you write about Devourers, the page *refuses* to stay still.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sermon">
    <line>Some mad cults worship them. They say Devourers unmake lies. I think they unmake *everything*.</line>
    <line>A Devourer sermon isn’t spoken. It’s *felt*. Like teeth behind your eyes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bones">
    <line>Devourers leave bones behind, sometimes arranged. Art, or warning?</line>
    <line>One pile of bones I found spelled my initials. That was... clarifying.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="curse">
    <line>They leave curses behind. On land, on memory, on legacy.</line>
    <line>Some say they’re cursed beasts. I say they *are* the curse, given shape.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>Their steps don’t echo. Their *absence* does.</line>
    <line>A Devourer’s presence isn’t felt—it’s noticed only when it leaves, and what’s missing is you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="talon">
    <line>Their claws shear iron. I watched one disembowel a warhorse mid-charge.</line>
    <line>One talon in the rib cage and the man kept screaming. That’s what made me start hunting.</line>

    <line>Diamonds are judged by the absence of color—yet it’s the presence of it that stirs my soul. Do you know of carat?</line>
    <line>Subtle hues make a diamond whisper secrets. But size? Ah, that’s the language of carats.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="carat">
    <line>Carat—the weight, the mass, the anchor of worth. But it’s not just size... it’s gravitas.</line>

    <line>Polish—careful, loving abrasion. A final whisper of artistry. Yet what of inclusion—the flaws within?</line>

    <line>Perfect polish reveals every truth, every inclusion. Let us examine the heart of imperfection.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="inclusion">
    <line>Inclusions are the birthmarks of a gem. Some say flaws; I say memories.</line>
    <line>The inclusion tells of origin. A trapped breath, a hidden ember. What’s a gem without a story? Would you gather some for me?</line>
    <line>Some flee flaws. I embrace them—they show life. Are you bold enough to collect diamonds for my work?</line>

  <entry keyword="direwolf">
    <line>Not just a beast. A force. Larger than horses, with eyes that know hunger and history.</line>
    <line>Dire wolves don’t stalk—they reign. Every step a statement. Every kill, art and argument.</line>
    <line>I once watched a pack bring down a forest elk. Didn’t need to. Just wanted to prove they could.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>They travel in silence, surround you before you know you’re prey.</line>
    <line>Moonlight and mist—that’s when they move. Never alone. Never loud.</line>
    <line>They test you. Nip at your courage. Break the spirit before they break the bones.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hate">
    <line>They took my mentor. Left nothing but shredded notes and one boot.</line>
    <line>Hate? No. Reverence tangled with revenge. They *taught* me fear—and now I return the lesson.</line>

  <entry keyword="howl">
    <line>A dire wolf’s howl isn’t sound—it’s soul. Makes lesser beasts weep. Made me drop my sword once.</line>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>Some say dire wolves sing to the wind. Others say it’s a death song. Either way, don’t listen too long.</line>

  <entry keyword="scar">

  <entry keyword="wound">
    <line>A dire wolf wound festers if not burned. Learned that the hard way.</line>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>Wolves don’t echo. The forest swallows their sound. Or maybe it respects it.</line>
    <line>Once heard my own voice echo in their den. Came out a different person.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="den">
    <line>Dire wolf dens are colder than outside air. It's like even heat fears them.</line>

    <line>They stack bones at the edges of their territory. Not as warning—*as invitation*.</line>

  <entry keyword="voice">
    <line>They don’t speak. But they listen. And sometimes... sometimes they answer.</line>
    <line>Once, I heard a voice while tracking them. My own. But I wasn’t speaking.</line>

  <entry keyword="blood">

    <line>Bleed one on sacred ground, and the earth trembles. Or so I’ve seen.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>Some tribes honor them with ritual hunts. Most don’t survive the offering.</line>
    <line>I joined a wolf rite once. The chant ended. The howling didn’t.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feast">
    <line>They don’t eat like animals. They *dismantle* their meals—piece by piece.</line>
    <line>I watched one feast once. Eyes locked on mine the whole time. Didn’t blink.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="night">
    <line>Night is their kingdom. Daylight is just a truce.</line>
    <line>You’ll never hear one in daylight unless it wants you to. That’s a warning.</line>

    <line>They silence the forest when they hunt. No birds. No wind. Just dread.</line>
    <line>When everything goes quiet, don’t breathe. Don’t move. Don’t *hope*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>The wind shifts when they approach. Warmer. Sharper. Tastes like ash and fur.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>One eye glows. The other watches. No one knows why.</line>
    <line>A dire wolf with one eye spared me once. I think it *remembered* me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="curse">
    <line>Some say dire wolves are cursed. I say the *curse* is surviving an encounter.</line>
    <line>Old druid claimed they’re bound to a forgotten moon goddess. Makes sense. They *worship nothing*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>The trees whisper when wolves move through them. They’ve learned fear too.</line>
    <line>Heard my name in the wind once. Then saw paw prints. Still don’t know which scared me more.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>They hate fire—but they never run from it. Just *around* it.</line>
    <line>I lit a fire once for protection. Found it out the next morning. Still warm. Still *wet*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cubs">
    <line>They guard their young with eerie tenderness. I’ve seen one die standing over a cub.</line>
    <line>Dire wolf cubs are born snarling. Cute, if you’re into things that bite first.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="legend">
    <line>Old tales say dire wolves were spirits once—bound to flesh by vengeance.</line>
    <line>One legend claims dire wolves were guardians of ancient kings. They chose exile over slavery.</line>

    <line>The deep woods belong to them. We pass through like whispers, hoping not to be heard.</line>

  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>Some call me a scholar. Others, a madman. I collect and study the strange—chiefly, the revolting Fetid Essences.</line>
    <line>My work is immersion in the foul. You seek secrets? Ask me of my obsession.</line>
    <line>I research the grotesque. Fetid Essences are my specialty and, regrettably, my nemesis.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="essence">
    <line>The Fetid Essence is a creature of pure stench and corruption, drawn to decay like moths to flame.</line>
    <line>They manifest in swamps, graveyards, and anywhere rot holds court. Their forms flicker, but the smell is constant.</line>
    <line>Obsessed with filth, animated by it. To know a Fetid Essence is to know disgust in its purest form. Want to hear more of their... aroma?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smell">
    <line>Their stench is legendary. I once bottled a sample. It broke, and three villagers still haven’t forgiven me.</line>
    <line>The scent clings for days—sour, metallic, almost intelligent. Once, I tried to mask it. The mask ran away.</line>
    <line>No perfume, no incense, no fire can conquer that smell. I keep a bottle for study—if you dare inquire about it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bottle">
    <line>I collect their essence in alchemical bottles. Handle with care: one crack, and you’ll smell nightmares.</line>
    <line>My collection is my pride, my shame, and, sometimes, my doom. The bottles hum softly, as if remembering their hosts.</line>
    <line>The bottles are sealed with wax, prayers, and regret. I use them for experiment—sometimes, to my sorrow.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="experiment">
    <line>Experiments? Many. Once, I tried to distill a cure for the stench. Instead, I made it stronger.</line>
    <line>I hoped to harness their essence for alchemy. My assistant still glows in the dark—sometimes.</line>
    <line>My greatest failure? I tried to cleanse them, to turn filth into purity. They laughed. Yes, they <em>laughed</em>. That is why I must purge them.</line>

  <entry keyword="purge" itemType="KillQuestScroll" ctorArgs="FetidEssence,6,9000">
    <line>It’s time to cleanse this world. Hunt down six Fetid Essences and I shall reward you for your service—and my vengeance.</line>

    <line>Talk is cheap. Action, costly. Slay six Fetid Essences for me. This scroll will record your progress—and, perhaps, lift my curse.</line>

    <line>Swamps are their playground—sludge, frogs, and a thousand hidden eyes.</line>
    <line>If your boots dissolve, you’re close. If your nose does, you’re closer.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="decay">
    <line>Decay is their delight. They dance in rot. Some say they accelerate it, like mold with a will.</line>
    <line>Once I saw a Fetid Essence whisper to a rotting log. In a day, the log vanished. Coincidence?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mud">
    <line>Mud’s no friend, but better than essence-slime. If it bubbles, run.</line>
    <line>They hide in bubbling mud, waiting. It’s their idea of a spa day.</line>

  <entry keyword="mist">
    <line>Mist hides much, but their stink pierces it.</line>
    <line>If the mist smells sweet, beware—it’s covering something worse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="toad">
    <line>Toads like fetid places. But even they leap away from an approaching Essence.</line>
    <line>Some say Fetid Essences ride toads like horses. I say the toads are simply fleeing.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="alchemy">
    <line>Alchemy brought me close to truth and ruin. Essences are the puzzle I can’t solve.</line>
    <line>Some try to bottle their power. Most end up bottling regret.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rags">
    <line>I wear rags, soaked in vinegar. It helps—barely.</line>
    <line>A true scholar of filth never launders his study clothes. They’d run away if you tried.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fungus">
    <line>Fungi love Essences, or perhaps Essences love fungi. Who can say?</line>
    <line>There’s a mushroom that grows only where they walk. It glows green and smells of cheese.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cheese">
    <line>Cheese left out too long sometimes attracts Essences. I no longer eat cheese.</line>
    <line>One Essence mistook my lunch for kin. I haven’t had a peaceful meal since.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Essences cast strange shadows, twisted and wet. Don’t follow them.</line>
    <line>Once I saw my own shadow wave back at me after an Essence passed by.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grudge">
    <line>I hold a grudge against every Essence. They hold grudges too, I think.</line>
    <line>My feud with them is personal. Ask me about my <em>family</em>—if you dare.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="family">
    <line>They stole from me—my brother, my peace, my sleep. All lost to their taint.</line>
    <line>If you lose someone to an Essence, you never forget. Or forgive.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rain">
    <line>Rain makes the smell rise from the earth. Beware after storms.</line>
    <line>I once hoped rain would wash them away. It only makes them stronger.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="coin">
    <line>I’d pay gold for clean air. Instead, I pay with my nose.</line>
    <line>They have no need for coin. But sometimes I find one glinting in the muck, left as a lure.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pet">
    <line>Never keep a Fetid Essence as a pet. It’ll keep you, instead.</line>
    <line>A mad wizard once tried. His house now has legs.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>They haunt my sleep. My dreams stink of them.</line>
    <line>Don’t fall asleep near a swamp. You might wake up changed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>They hate mirrors. Or maybe mirrors hate them. Hard to say.</line>
    <line>I tried using a mirror to repel one. Now, my mirror is green.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="color">
    <line>Their color shifts—green, gray, sickly yellow—like sickness come alive.</line>
    <line>Once, one turned purple. That was a bad week.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="book">
    <line>I keep a journal, but the pages keep falling out when I write about them.</line>
    <line>My book smells so bad now, even the rats won’t touch it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rat">
    <line>Rats flee when Essences come. Smart creatures.</line>
    <line>I once saw a rat and an Essence stare at each other. The rat won.</line>

  <entry keyword="luck">
    <line>Bad luck follows them, like a cloud. Or maybe it’s just the smell.</line>
    <line>I wore a lucky charm once. It melted.</line>

  <entry keyword="cloak">
    <line>I wear a cloak, but it’s only to spare others my scent.</line>
    <line>Cloaks do little against them, unless soaked in regret.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>They hate music. Or maybe I just wish they did.</line>
    <line>I played a flute once to charm them. The flute turned green. So did I.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shoes">
    <line>Never wear new shoes in their territory. They’ll never be new again.</line>
    <line>I lost a boot to an Essence. It crawled away.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="candle">
    <line>Candles flicker and die in their presence, as if the flame itself can’t stand them.</line>
    <line>I tried to mask the smell with scented candles. Now I hate both scents.</line>

<trait name="Doppelganger Scholar" priority="40">
  <entry keyword="doppelganger">
    <line>They wear your face like a mask, but their eyes never quite learn your soul.</line>
    <line>A doppelganger studies you, becomes you, breaks you. Then pretends nothing ever happened.</line>
    <line>You haven’t known fear until your own reflection asks why you’re still alive.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mimic">
    <line>They mimic voices, memories—even wounds. But never emotions. Never grief.</line>
    <line>A mimic's greatest flaw? They don’t understand *why* we cry. Just that we do.</line>
    <line>They parrot love. They *perform* trust. But they never *feel* it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eyes">
    <line>Look closely—the eyes are always slightly wrong. Too focused. Too perfect.</line>
    <line>No matter the face they wear, the eyes betray them. As if painted on wet glass.</line>
    <line>Their eyes scan, not see. Cold calculations behind warm gazes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="voice">
    <line>Their voice matches the tone, but not the pauses. You know your friend wouldn’t speak so… *cleanly*.</line>
    <line>You’ll hear it in the way they emphasize the wrong words. Like an echo that learned to lie.</line>
    <line>They copy your voice, but can’t mimic your doubt. That’s how you find them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hate">
    <line>One wore my brother’s skin for weeks. I only realized after the real one rotted out of a tree hollow.</line>
    <line>They don’t just kill. They *replace*. And everyone thanks them for it.</line>
    <line>I hate them not for what they do, but for how good they are at pretending to *care*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>They study from afar. I once caught one watching me through a mirror... backwards.</line>
    <line>They eat alone. They fear being observed in their *real* form.</line>
    <line>They prefer isolated towns—fewer memories to fake, easier victims to fold into.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="form">
    <line>True form? Slick, grey, and featureless—like wax melting over muscle.</line>
    <line>Beneath the disguise, they're all the same: shifting shadows wrapped in imitation.</line>
    <line>I saw its real form once. It smiled with no mouth. I still dream of that grin.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="slay">
    <line>You want to do something useful? Bring me the heads of ten doppelgangers. Show me you see them for what they are.</line>
    <line>If you think you understand what they are... prove it. Ten doppelgangers. One truth. Take this scroll.</line>
    <line>I’ve hunted them for years. Now it’s your turn. Slay ten and earn my trust. This scroll will track your work.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Red herrings and flavor -->

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>I haven’t trusted a mirror in years. I cover them all. They look back too well.</line>
    <line>A doppelganger won’t cast a reflection while shifting. That’s your chance—strike then.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grin">
    <line>When they grin, it’s too symmetrical. Too sharp. Like a smile printed from memory.</line>
    <line>No real person smiles that wide. It’s like they think happiness is measured in teeth.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="touch">
    <line>Their touch is colder. Not cold—but *wrong*. Like silk over bone.</line>
    <line>A friend hugs you with warmth. A doppelganger does it with calculation.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>They don’t sleep as we do. They stare at the ceiling and breathe like they’re rehearsing.</line>
    <line>Caught one faking sleep—blinking out of rhythm. Ever see a dreamless imposter? It’s... chilling.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="replacement">
    <line>You won’t know your friend’s been replaced until it’s too late. Unless you already *doubt* them.</line>
    <line>Replacements happen in the night. Swift, silent. Next day? No one remembers the real one existed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scent">
    <line>They mask their scent well. But dogs still know. Trust the dogs.</line>
    <line>A doppelganger smells faintly of ink and damp stone. You’ll know when you know.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="knife">
    <line>A blade doesn’t lie. Cut them, and they bleed silver-gray for a second before the mask reforms.</line>
    <line>I carry silvered steel—not because it kills better, but because it *stings* them into truth.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Fire ruins the mimicry. Flesh curls and can’t hold the lie.</line>
    <line>They burn like parchment soaked in oil. Beautiful, awful truth revealed in ash.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lie">
    <line>They lie *perfectly*—until you ask about something only you would know. Then they hesitate.</line>
    <line>The truth trips them up. Force it into the conversation, and you’ll see them twitch.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="truth">
    <line>Truth is the one thing they can’t fake. Speak it often. They’ll squirm.</line>
    <line>Truth is their poison. Use it well. Like a mirror with fangs.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadows">
    <line>They move wrong in shadow—too smooth, like they’re rehearsing for an audience.</line>
    <line>You ever see a shadow split from the body for just a second? That’s not imagination.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="heartbeat">
    <line>Doppelgangers don’t blink with a heartbeat. Because they don’t have one—not really.</line>
    <line>Place your hand on their chest. You’ll feel it beating too slow. Like it's faking the rhythm.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="laugh">
    <line>Their laugh is hollow. Not forced—*copied*. Like a sound they don’t understand.</line>
    <line>A doppelganger’s laugh sounds like someone learning joy by script.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="family">
    <line>The ones closest to you are the easiest for them to wear. Because you *want* to believe.</line>
    <line>I buried my mother twice. Once for real, once when I realized she’d been *replaced*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="photograph">
    <line>Old photos catch the difference. A smile too wide, eyes too sharp. Paper doesn’t lie.</line>
    <line>Found an old portrait once. The real one smiled. The fake just stared—waiting to be discovered.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="soup">
    <line>A doppelganger cooked for me once. Forgot the salt. My brother *never* forgot the salt.</line>
    <line>Watch them during dinner. Real people fidget, chew, chat. Fakes just *consume.*</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="language">
    <line>They speak perfectly. Too perfectly. No stutters, no 'ums', no hesitation.</line>
    <line>Ask them to curse. Doppelgangers hate vulgarity—it breaks their illusion of control.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>They can replicate scars—but not how you got them. Ask. Watch them flinch.</line>
    <line>My father had a scar from a forge burn. The thing pretending to be him said it came from a dog.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="handshake">
    <line>Doppelgangers grip too firm or too soft. Like they’ve read about handshakes but never given one.</line>
    <line>Their palms are too dry. Or too wet. Never normal. It's unsettling every time.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silence">
    <line>It’s the silence that gives them away. Real people fill gaps with breath, taps, hums. They… wait.</line>
    <line>They don’t like silence. Makes them think. And thinking shows the cracks.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wound">
    <line>They don’t bleed right. It’s not red—not exactly. More like melted wax mixed with shadow.</line>
    <line>Hurt one bad enough and the skin slides wrong. Like it’s wearing itself backward.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="door">
    <line>Saw one hesitate before opening a door. Like it was calculating what the ‘real’ version would do.</line>
    <line>Doppelgangers fear thresholds. They step over them like crossing into unfamiliar skin.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>The wind doesn’t move their hair right. It *reacts*—like it’s not really part of them.</line>
    <line>Ever seen someone not shiver in the cold? Maybe they don’t *feel* like we do.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>They hum, but never in tune. Like they heard music once and tried to copy it from memory.</line>
    <line>A doppelganger sang me a lullaby once. Every word perfect. Every *note* was wrong.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="child">
    <line>Children know. They cry near doppelgangers. Or worse—they go silent.</line>
    <line>A child pointed at my friend and said, 'That’s not him.' He was right.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>They hate ink. Refuse to write things down. Something about permanence unsettles them.</line>
    <line>Hand one a quill. They’ll hesitate. Their handwriting always looks borrowed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clothing">
    <line>Their clothes don’t wrinkle the right way. Like they’re draped over a statue.</line>
    <line>A friend wore a coat I’d never seen before. Swore he always had it. I still buried the *real* him later.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>I don’t dream anymore. Not since one of them whispered in my sleep.</line>
    <line>They say doppelgangers don’t dream. They *watch* yours instead.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>Heard an echo answer me once before I spoke. That wasn’t the cave. That was *one of them*.</line>
    <line>Some say their true form echoes faintly when they're near. Like a second voice in the dark.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="journal">
    <line>I write in my journal each night—to remind myself I’m still me.</line>
    <line>A doppelganger once handed me my own journal. Every page was wrong—but close.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>Their blood doesn’t stain. It fades too quickly. Like it's shy of truth.</line>
    <line>I’ve spilled enough of their blood to know: it doesn’t *smell* right.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="imposter">
    <line>We all fear being replaced. Some of us already have been.</line>
    <line>If I’m not the real me, I hope the real me died quickly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trust">
    <line>Don’t trust me. That’s the first step. Paranoia saves lives.</line>
    <line>Trust is a currency the doppelgangers counterfeit better than gold.</line>

    <line>Dread Warhorses haunt my dreams. Their very presence turns courage to ash. It’s the *mane*—it never stops moving.</line>
    <line>Why do I hate and love them? Once, I tried to *tame* one. Its mane scorched my hand, its scream split my mind.</line>
    <line>Dread is not just a name. When you see that horse, you’ll understand why people call it a *nightmare*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mane">
    <line>The mane of a Dread Warhorse writhes like living smoke, blacker than regret. I once lost a finger trying to braid it.</line>
    <line>To touch a Dread mane is to know true pain—worse, it lingers, haunting your bones. They say it’s a gift. It isn’t.</line>

  <entry keyword="cloak">
    <line>I wear a cloak made from burnt saddlecloth. The only thing that keeps their chill away.</line>
    <line>A Dread Warhorse’s breath can freeze your cloak solid. Learned that the hard way.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>Mist and mane, that’s all you see at first. Then the fear hits.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spook">
    <line>Normal horses spook at shadows. Dread Warhorses spook the shadows themselves.</line>
    <line>Try to spook a Dread Warhorse, and it just laughs—somehow.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tailor">
    <line>No tailor will work for me since the Dread incident. Something about cursed fabric.</line>

    <line>Candlelight makes their eyes shine red. It’s a warning, not an invitation.</line>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>Songs confuse them, but only briefly. Their minds twist music into riddles.</line>
    <line>Never play a lullaby in Gazer country. The dreams attract them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="coin">
    <line>Coins sometimes appear in their lairs—bitten, bent, always tarnished. Some sort of collection, perhaps?</line>
    <line>An Elder Gazer has no use for gold, but they hoard trinkets all the same.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flesh">
    <line>Flesh is meaningless to them. They hunger for the mind, not the body.</line>
    <line>Do not confuse Elder Gazers with ogres or beasts. They eat differently.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sigil">
    <line>Sigils carved by Elder Gazers warp over time. Do not try to read them—they read you instead.</line>
    <line>Once, I saw a sigil writhe. It left a scar on my mind, not my flesh.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="altar">
    <line>Some cults worship Elder Gazers, offering secrets and sacrifices.</line>
    <line>If you find an altar of eyes, leave. Quickly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bargain">
    <line>Never bargain with an Elder Gazer. Their price is always higher than you can imagine.</line>
    <line>If one offers you knowledge, remember: payment is extracted in memories.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="storm">
    <line>Storms draw them out—they claim the air is thick with forgotten prayers.</line>
    <line>I once watched a Gazer float through lightning. Not even a scorch mark.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="child">
    <line>Children sometimes see them where adults do not. Listen if a child points at nothing.</line>
    <line>A child’s imagination is a feast for an Elder Gazer.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chime">
    <line>Windchimes drive them off for a time—their frequencies scramble Gazer thoughts.</line>
    <line>I hang chimes in my window. Not for luck—for warning.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>Under a full moon, Elder Gazers seem stronger. Some say they remember their origin on such nights.</line>
    <line>The new moon brings hunger. Beware their feeding then.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="quill">
    <line>Some say an Elder Gazer can control a quill with its mind. Most of my research was written under surveillance.</line>
    <line>If your writing wanders, suspect a Gazer’s influence.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wine">
    <line>Elder Gazers cannot taste wine, but some keep bottles in their lairs. Trophies, perhaps.</line>
    <line>Once, I drank from a Gazer’s bottle. I lost the taste for joy, but gained a tolerance for terror.</line>

    <line>My days are spent documenting Elf Brigand habits, hoarding grudges, and plotting their downfall.</line>

  <entry keyword="elf brigand">
    <line>A contradiction—beauty turned banditry. They rob, trick, and vanish. I’ve catalogued every tactic.</line>
    <line>Elf Brigands: once noble, now outlaws. They hide their faces with leaves, but not their shame.</line>
    <line>No creature’s more infuriating. Graceful as dancers, greedy as goblins.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>They strike at dawn, disappear by dusk. Like ghosts with a taste for gold and poetry.</line>
    <line>Habits? Flawless ambushes, cryptic codes, and a passion for wine. Especially *my* wine.</line>
    <line>Never fight fair. Traps, tricks, and misleading trails. I’ve mapped their routines across the woods.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wine">
    <line>That’s the reason for my grudge. Stole my family’s ancestral cask. Worth more than my library.</line>
    <line>They didn’t just steal wine—they insulted my heritage. I’ve sworn to reclaim it, sip by sip.</line>
    <line>Lost to Elf Brigands, my grandfather’s vintage now sweetens their crimes. That, I cannot forgive.</line>

  <entry keyword="grudge">
    <line>Some study out of curiosity. I study out of spite. Each note is a promise of retribution.</line>

  <entry keyword="poetry">
    <line>Elf Brigands pen poetry before raids. Pretentious, isn’t it? Leaves behind verses and victims.</line>
    <line>You’ll find a poem on every corpse. Usually bad rhymes about trees and freedom.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="leaves">
    <line>They weave leaves into masks. Think it makes them invisible. It just makes them smug.</line>
    <line>Find a clump of woven leaves? An Elf Brigand passed by. Or a bored druid.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trick">
    <line>If you hear laughter in the trees, prepare for a trick. Elf Brigands love practical jokes. Cruel ones.</line>
    <line>Trickery is their nature. I once found my boots tied together—mid-chase.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ambush">
    <line>Ambush is an Elf Brigand greeting. Don’t accept their invitations.</line>
    <line>If the forest goes quiet, you’re already surrounded. Ambush etiquette, they call it.</line>

    <line>Mask an Elf Brigand’s face, but you can’t mask their intent.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>Loot? They hoard trinkets, poems, and stolen dignity.</line>
    <line>Never underestimate what they’ll steal. I lost a sock once. Mid-conversation.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="songs">
    <line>They sing after raids—terrible voices. Like birds learning to cough.</line>
    <line>An Elf Brigand’s song is warning enough. If you hear it, run the other way.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="siblings">
    <line>Elf Brigands often raid with siblings. Double the talent, double the arrogance.</line>
    <line>Never trust twins in the woods. One smiles, one steals your purse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dagger">
    <line>A Brigand’s dagger is their favorite friend. Sharp and frequently misplaced—into backs.</line>
    <line>Watch their hands, not their words. The daggers are faster.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cloak">
    <line>Their cloaks shimmer like water—expensive taste for a thief.</line>
    <line>Elf Brigand cloaks? Useful for hiding, or tripping on roots.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>They fear fire—it ruins the woods and their ambushes.</line>
    <line>Light a torch, and you’ll see them scatter. Or at least scowl.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>Full moon raids are tradition for Elf Brigands. Superstition or just good lighting?</line>
    <line>If you see moonlit shadows in the trees, keep your coin close.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tattoo">
    <line>Brigand tattoos tell stories. Too bad they rarely survive to explain them.</line>
    <line>A spiral tattoo means seniority. Or so I’m told. The dead don’t elaborate.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cheese">
    <line>Strangely, they adore hard cheese. Must be the crunch. Or the smell—keeps wolves away.</line>
    <line>Found cheese rinds in their camps. Never wine, always cheese. A culinary crime.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="jewelry">
    <line>They steal jewelry, but only wear wooden beads. A statement? Or just irony.</line>
    <line>Lost rings have a way of appearing on their fingers at inopportune times.</line>

  <entry keyword="owl">
    <line>They claim to speak to owls. I suspect it’s just late-night loneliness.</line>
    <line>Owl feathers in their hair—fashion, or failed magic?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trap">
    <line>They love snares and pitfalls. Even their camps are booby-trapped.</line>
    <line>Never sit on a log in Elf Brigand territory. It’s probably a trap. Or a seat for someone else.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Brigands move like shadows. Annoying and hard to swat.</line>
    <line>If your own shadow seems to move, you’re not alone.</line>

    <line>Ask an Elf Brigand about their scars—they’ll tell you a story. Or rob you while distracted.</line>
    <line>Each scar has a name, and an alibi.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="armor">
    <line>Light armor, easy to run in. Not much for stopping arrows, though.</line>
    <line>They call it ‘nature’s embrace’—I call it poor planning.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="herbs">
    <line>They brew their own potions from forest herbs. Results vary—sometimes they just get dizzy.</line>
    <line>Herbs for healing, for poison, and for flavor. Elf Brigands rarely cook, but when they do, beware.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fortune">
    <line>They believe in fortune—cards, runes, and a healthy sense of optimism.</line>
    <line>I let one read my fortune once. Still waiting for my socks to return.</line>

    <line>Emeralds—verdant drops of eternity! Do you know their lore? Their affinity with clarity and focus?</line>
    <line>Ah, emeralds... They whisper wisdom to those who listen. Their luster hides ancient truths. Perhaps you've pondered clarity?</line>
    <line>You speak of emeralds! A jewel of insight. Have you ever contemplated their clarity and resonance?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clarity">
    <line>Clarity—both of the gem and the mind. It is the soul of any true emerald. But clarity must be polished, much like focus.</line>
    <line>True clarity refracts the self. Still, one must learn to focus, as a jeweler does under candlelight.</line>
    <line>Clarity is the threshold to focus, and focus the key to emerald enlightenment. Would you like to know more of focus?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="focus">
    <line>Focus gives purpose to passion. With it, the emerald reveals even its flaws as facets of beauty. But beware illusions...</line>
    <line>Focus sharpens the gaze—but even a sharp eye may be fooled. Do illusions tempt your curiosity?</line>
    <line>Focus reveals. Illusion conceals. Between them lies perception. Let’s speak of illusion.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="illusion">
    <line>Illusion cloaks truth like clouds over crystal. Yet the trained eye sees through to the structure beneath...</line>
    <line>Emeralds sometimes hide fractures. They wear illusions like masks. You know what reveals all? Structure.</line>
    <line>What is illusion but broken light? Let us turn to structure—the integrity within the stone.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="structure">
    <line>Structure—yes! The lattice of the emerald, shaped by pressure and time. But time also grants resonance...</line>
    <line>The inner structure holds the memory of ages. And those echoes? That is resonance.</line>
    <line>Structure supports beauty. But resonance gives it voice. Shall I speak of resonance?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="resonance">
    <line>Resonance—the echo of emeralds through spirit. Can you feel their energy? Some say it’s a conduit of purpose.</line>
    <line>An emerald resonates with its bearer. Purpose finds shape in that vibration. Are you ready to find your purpose?</line>
    <line>If you’ve followed this resonance so far, perhaps you’re ready to align with purpose itself.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="purpose">
    <line>Purpose... Yes. You see, I gather emeralds not for wealth, but for a grand harmonic experiment. I need many—will you assist me?</line>
    <line>Now you understand! I am compiling a resonance lattice, and I need emeralds—many of them. Will you aid my work?</line>

  <!-- Red Herring Dialogue Chain -->

  <entry keyword="sapphire">
    <line>Sapphires? A cold, distant beauty. Some worship their blue fire—but they lack the soul of emerald.</line>
    <line>Sapphires are the ocean to emerald's forest. Pretty, yes, but do they *resonate* with you?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glass">
    <line>Glass mocks the gemstone—clear, brittle, hollow. Yet it’s useful for deception.</line>
    <line>Some mistake glass for gem. A fool’s clarity! But even glass has its purpose.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="color">
    <line>Color is but one note in the symphony of a stone. Green is life—but also envy.</line>
    <line>Emeralds are green, yes, but green is not the gem. The soul lies in structure, not shade.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="forest">
    <line>The forest and the emerald share a secret: layered growth under pressure.</line>
    <line>In the forest, like in stone, time shapes the unseen. But trees whisper slower than crystals.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="green">
    <line>Green, yes—but do not be fooled. Not all that is green glows with truth.</line>
    <line>Green is the color of growth... and jealousy. Emeralds hold both within.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="jeweler">
    <line>A jeweler knows the surface. A gem harmonist? We delve deeper.</line>
    <line>Jewelry is adornment. But I seek connection—resonance!</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="alchemy">
    <line>Alchemy seeks gold. But gems—they contain the *principle* of transformation.</line>
    <line>They call alchemists fools for chasing change. Yet I ask: what is an emerald but a stone transformed?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pressure">
    <line>Pressure forms diamonds, yes—but it *shapes* emeralds with subtlety.</line>
    <line>Too much pressure, and an emerald cracks. Resilience is not brute force.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fracture">
    <line>Fractures in an emerald are like scars on a soul—imperfections that tell a deeper story.</line>
    <line>Fractures reflect the journey. Even the finest emerald holds a secret crack.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dust">
    <line>Emerald dust—useless to merchants, but perhaps... vital to my lattice theory.</line>
    <line>Some gems crumble to dust. But even dust retains the song of the crystal lattice.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="golem">
    <line>Long ago, I tried setting emeralds into a construct... a golem of clarity. It didn’t end well.</line>
    <line>The golem... yes, I gave it emerald eyes. It saw too much. Now I keep my creations small.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vision">
    <line>Vision without clarity is a dream. Emeralds grant more than sight—they sharpen purpose.</line>
    <line>Some say emeralds grant visions. I say they *focus* the mind to finally see.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="obsidian">
    <line>Obsidian? A lovely stone... but blunt. It absorbs, while emerald *amplifies*.</line>
    <line>Obsidian is the silence to emerald’s song. Still, it has its place.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trade">
    <line>Trade is for the masses. I do not *buy* emeralds—I study, I *commune*.</line>
    <line>Market prices are noise. Resonance cannot be weighed in coin.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>Did you know a gem’s resonance can be transposed into music? I’ve heard the hum of emerald in E minor.</line>
    <line>Once, I played a lute strung with gem-tuned filaments. The emerald string? Sublime and sorrowful.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moonlight">
    <line>Moonlight reveals what sunlight hides. Some of my best emerald readings come at dusk.</line>
    <line>Emeralds under moonlight... they whisper differently. A silver glow shifts their tone.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mage">
    <line>Mages use crystals for power. I use them for *understanding*. There is a difference.</line>
    <line>Many a mage has begged for my emeralds. I do not share lightly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>A mirror reflects only the surface. But an emerald reflects the soul.</line>
    <line>You can’t polish a soul—but an emerald might just refract one.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="book">
    <line>Books speak in ink. Gems speak in resonance. Still, I keep a few tomes around.</line>
    <line>I once read a book on gem lore that was entirely wrong. I keep it as a lesson.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="storm">
    <line>Emeralds thrum stronger during storms. Lightning excites the resonance lattice.</line>
    <line>Storms awaken the latent tone in stones. Emeralds sing beneath thunder.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="time">
    <line>Time compresses, folds, sings. That’s how emeralds are born.</line>
    <line>Time doesn't just pass—it presses. It sculpts stones and seekers alike.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cat">
    <line>My emerald once disappeared. The cat had taken it. Thought it a toy. A tragic misjudgment.</line>
    <line>Beware cats. They do *love* shiny things. One cost me a particularly harmonic shard.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="map">
    <line>I once made a map of resonance zones across the realm. Few believed me. Fools.</line>
    <line>There are places where emeralds hum—hidden points of power. I’ve charted some.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>I once dreamed of a gem that vibrated in my palm. Woke up to a broken ring.</line>
    <line>Emeralds don’t sleep. But I do. Occasionally. With one under my pillow.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>If you listen closely... emeralds whisper. Or maybe that’s just me.</line>
    <line>Some say the voices of old kings linger in gems. I don’t discount it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="light">
    <line>Light bends through emeralds in curious ways. Some say it speaks.</line>
    <line>Hold an emerald to the light. It doesn’t just shine—it refracts *intention*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>A mirror reflects surface truths. An emerald reveals the inner ones.</line>
    <line>Do you stare into mirrors, or through stones? The difference defines seekers from collectors.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="collector">
    <line>Collectors hoard. Seekers uncover. Which are you, I wonder?</line>
    <line>The world is full of collectors, but few become harmonists. Seek the resonance, not just the shine.</line>

  <entry keyword="reason">
    <line>One cost me my family’s farm. Eowmu flooded the fields, devoured every root. My kin lost to famine and fever.</line>
    <line>Hate is a strong word, but I lost more than land to Eowmu—they destroyed what I loved, and left only ruin.</line>
    <line>They say Eowmu are harmless. Let them eat through your home’s foundation and see how harmless they feel.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="farm">
    <line>It was generations old—fertile and green—until the Eowmu came. Their tunnels collapsed the wells and their slime poisoned the crops.</line>
    <line>The old farmhouse sits empty now, the ground soft and treacherous with Eowmu burrows. I can still hear them beneath the soil.</line>
    <line>All that remains is a sunken patch of mud and the memory of what once was. Eowmu did that.</line>

  <entry keyword="merchant">
    <line>I once traded Eowmu hide. The buyers never returned. Can’t blame them.</line>
    <line>No merchant sane enough will handle Eowmu goods. Too slimy, too cursed.</line>

    <line>I’ve set traps for Eowmu. Caught a boot once. The Eowmu wore it for days.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boots">
    <line>Wore Eowmu boots once. Never again. Soggy for days, even in sunlight.</line>
    <line>Eowmu in your boots? Burn them. The boots, not the Eowmu—though both is best.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>Bards won’t sing of Eowmu, but they hum the tune of their march.</line>
    <line>If you hear humming near marshes, move along—Eowmu love an audience.</line>

    <line>Some show Eowmu shells as trophies. I prefer memories of them leaving.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bitter">
    <line>Eowmu taste bitter, so I’m told. Never been desperate enough to try.</line>

  <entry keyword="lantern">
    <line>Hang a lantern, and Eowmu might avoid your camp. Or they might be curious.</line>

    <line>Ettins are two-headed giants—twice the stupidity, double the danger. Each head argues with the other, but both agree on crushing bones.</line>

    <line>Ask about their 'habits,' but only if you like stories that end with splinters and screaming.</line>

    <line>Ettins hoard shiny objects—usually stolen from travelers. One head likes weapons, the other likes anything that sparkles.</line>

    <line>Both heads fight over their loot. Once, one ate a silver spoon just to spite the other. Me? I lost a flute. Ask if you want to hear a sad story.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flute">
    <line>It was a family heirloom, passed down for generations—until an ettin snatched it. One head tried to play it; the other used it as a toothpick.</line>
    <line>Losing that flute to those brutes made me who I am—a relentless ettin hunter. If you want to help, just ask about my 'revenge.'</line>

    <line>Ettins fall for traps—if both heads are distracted at the same time.</line>
    <line>One head likes to spring traps. The other? Walks right into them anyway.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mothers">
    <line>Ettin mothers are said to be even bigger. Twice as loud, too.</line>

<trait name="Executioner Hunter" priority="40">
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>I study those who end lives for coin—the executioners. Some say it's a job; I call it a sickness.</line>
    <line>Ask me about my profession, and I'll tell you of masks, axes, and the stink of fear.</line>
    <line>They call me morbid, but I call myself a scholar of the axe. Executioners are my specialty.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mask">
    <line>Behind every executioner’s mask is a story, but most stories are too ugly to show their face.</line>
    <line>Masks—hiding more than faces. They hide guilt, regret, and sometimes grins.</line>
    <line>An executioner's mask smells of sweat, leather, and secrets. Ask about those secrets, if you dare.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="secret">
    <line>Secrets are the only thing heavier than an executioner's axe. Most are buried with the bodies.</line>
    <line>The biggest secret? Some executioners enjoy their work a little too much.</line>
    <line>I learned the hard way—never trust a masked smile. Some secrets bleed through the leather.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="family">
    <line>My family learned the price of secrets—my father vanished after a shadowed trial.</line>
    <line>An executioner’s work rarely leaves room for family. Mine was shattered by their blade.</line>
    <line>I was left with nothing but questions and a vendetta. My family’s blood stains my memory.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="revenge">
    <line>Revenge? It’s all that gets me up some mornings. That, and the hope of seeing a mask crack.</line>
    <line>Some say revenge is poison—I say it’s a torch. It lights my way to every executioner I can find.</line>
    <line>My revenge is personal. If you want to help, you’ll need a steady hand and a stronger stomach.</line>

  </entry>

  <!-- Red Herrings -->

  <entry keyword="axe">
    <line>The executioner’s axe is heavy with more than steel—it’s burdened by memory.</line>
    <line>Some axes are sharper than their wielders. Don’t let the shine fool you; it stains all the same.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gallows">
    <line>Gallows creak in the wind, but the true weight is what hangs from them.</line>
    <line>Some say you can hear the last prayers in the rope’s fibers. I say you hear regrets.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hood">
    <line>The hood hides a face, but never a conscience.</line>
    <line>Once, I pulled off a hood. Found nothing but a trembling boy underneath.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="coin">
    <line>Coin drives the axe as much as justice. Some are paid too well for what they do.</line>
    <line>Blood money spends the same, but it always leaves a stain.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="crow">
    <line>Crows gather after every execution—drawn by the promise of leftovers.</line>
    <line>They say crows remember faces. I hope they remember mine.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glove">
    <line>Executioners wear gloves not to stay clean, but to keep from slipping.</line>
    <line>Gloves come off when the job is done, but the filth lingers.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grief">
    <line>Every execution leaves a widow, a mother, or a memory.</line>
    <line>Grief feeds on silence and unanswered questions.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="justice">
    <line>Some call it justice, others call it vengeance in a cloak.</line>
    <line>Justice, they say. But who watches the one with the axe?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>Every scaffold holds whispers. Most are prayers. Some are curses.</line>
    <line>Listen close and you’ll hear what’s never written in court records.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fear">
    <line>Fear walks before the executioner—sometimes, it walks behind too.</line>
    <line>You can smell fear in the crowd—metallic, sharp, unforgettable.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trial">
    <line>Some trials are fair. Most are quick. Justice is rarely either.</line>
    <line>My father stood trial once. Only the axe was impartial.</line>

    <line>Executions at dawn. A new day, a last breath.</line>
    <line>The coldest sunrises are always over the scaffold.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>Blood washes off the blade, but never the mind.</line>
    <line>Executioners get used to the sight, or so they say. I doubt it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="record">
    <line>They keep records, but the ink is never as dark as the deeds.</line>
    <line>I searched the ledgers—my family’s name was missing. Only the blade remembered.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wine">
    <line>Executioners drink more than most. Some say to forget. Others, to celebrate.</line>
    <line>I once watched an executioner toast the crowd. The wine was red as sin.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bell">
    <line>A bell rings for the condemned. It echoes longer for the living.</line>
    <line>I hear bells in my dreams. Each toll is a name I can’t forget.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Executioners prefer shadows, where questions can’t follow.</line>
    <line>I chased one into the shadows once. Only I came back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blade">
    <line>Some blades are meant for show. The executioner’s blade is only for endings.</line>
    <line>If you see a blade without a nick, run. It’s waiting for its first story.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glare">
    <line>A glare from the condemned, a glare from the crowd. The executioner stares at neither.</line>
    <line>Eyes meet at the last moment—some look away, some don’t.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cloak">
    <line>Cloaks hide more than faces. They hide intent, and sometimes shame.</line>
    <line>A cloak can’t muffle the sound of an axe. I’ve tried.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sin">
    <line>Some sins are paid in silver, others in blood.</line>
    <line>Executioners collect more sins than coins, I think.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="poem">
    <line>Bards write poems about heroes. None about executioners.</line>
    <line>I tried to write a poem once. All I managed was a list of names.</line>

    <line>Some scars you can see. Others you only feel on cold nights.</line>
    <line>I have scars that have never bled. Those are the worst.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dog">
    <line>Stray dogs gather after an execution. They know where to find an easy meal.</line>
    <line>A dog once followed an executioner home. It never barked again.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chain">
    <line>Chains rattle in the night. They sound like memories.</line>
    <line>The condemned wear chains. The executioner wears none—but their steps are just as heavy.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="apprentice">
    <line>My apprentice tried to reason with a minion. Now I leave flowers at the scrapyard.</line>

  <entry keyword="fire daemon">
    <line>Fire Daemons, you say? They are both marvel and menace. I have studied their every ember.</line>
    <line>A Fire Daemon is not merely a beast of flame—it's a hunger that walks.</line>
    <line>To truly know a Fire Daemon, you must stare into the blaze and see what stares back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="origin">
    <line>Some say Fire Daemons were born from the first spark at the world's creation. I think they’re the memory of every grudge set alight.</line>
    <line>Their origin? The molten places, the cracks between the world and the hells. Fire Daemons crawl out when the earth is angry.</line>
    <line>There are scrolls that speak of gods who cast shadows into the flame, and the Daemons are those shadows given shape.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weakness">
    <line>Their arrogance is their weakness. Fire Daemons believe themselves untouchable. Douse their pride, and you can wound them.</line>
    <line>Water can dim them, but it will never kill. Cold iron stings, but it is the unyielding will that defeats them.</line>
    <line>Strike when their flames wane. After a great outburst, they are weakest, their form flickering and unstable.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hatred">
    <line>My reason for hatred? A Fire Daemon took everything from me—home, family, hope. All ashes, all gone.</line>
    <line>I once sought knowledge; now, vengeance fuels my pen. I will see Fire Daemons banished, or burn trying.</line>

  <entry keyword="obsession">
    <line>Obsession is a flame itself. I cannot turn away from the study of fire, though it consumes me.</line>
    <line>Some call me mad for my fascination. Perhaps I am, but madness keeps me vigilant.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="books">
    <line>My library is filled with burnt edges and half-truths. Books do not fare well in a scholar’s inferno.</line>

    <line>Daemons hate cloth—something about how it smothers their flames.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="doubt">
    <line>Doubt is the first step to defeat. Fire Daemons sense hesitation like wolves smell blood.</line>
    <line>Never doubt your swing. Against a daemon, a single heartbeat of hesitation is fatal.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="salt">
    <line>Old stories claim salt circles repel Fire Daemons. I say: try it, but keep your sword ready.</line>
    <line>Salt in a wound burns—but so does a daemon’s touch.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="portal">
    <line>Daemons often emerge from fiery portals. Never trust a flicker in the air.</line>
    <line>I once saw a portal of pure flame. Three daemons stepped through. Only I lived to remember.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grudge">
    <line>Fire Daemons remember every slight—every attempt on their life. They do not forgive.</line>
    <line>A daemon with a grudge will pursue its enemy beyond the grave. Trust me—I know.</line>

  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>Every scar I bear tells a tale of fire. Each one is a lesson in pain and survival.</line>
    <line>A true Fire Daemon hunter is marked by burns, not by medals.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="betrayal">
    <line>Betrayal burns hotter than any daemon’s fire. I have known both.</line>
    <line>Some say daemons cannot be trusted. I say, neither can most people.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>On nights of the full moon, their flames burn blue. Do not ask me why.</line>

    <line>If you see steam by the river, watch for FireSteeds cooling their tempers.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="herd">
    <line>A herd of FireSteeds is a stampede of storms. Only a fool tries to count them.</line>
    <line>Herds run in circles—faster, hotter, and louder than any thunder I’ve known.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="breath">
    <line>Their breath smells like smoke and singed fur. Not pleasant, unless you’re a dragon.</line>
    <line>Stand too close, and you’ll think you’re at a bonfire. Only less safe.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gold">
    <line>FireSteeds care nothing for gold—unless it melts. Then they play with it.</line>
    <line>Gold coins are nice, but you can’t bribe a FireSteed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rider">
    <line>Only the mad or the doomed try to ride one. I was both, once.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="carrot">
    <line>You ever try feeding a FireSteed a carrot? Watch it turn to ash.</line>
    <line>They’re not picky eaters. But carrots? Only if roasted.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="saddle">
    <line>No saddle survives. Leather cooks, metal scorches. Maybe try magic next time.</line>
    <line>I spent a year designing a FireSteed saddle. It lasted a minute.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="night">
    <line>At night, their flames burn blue. It’s haunting—and beautiful, in a way.</line>
    <line>You hear a distant crackle after dark? Don’t follow. Trust me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hoofprints">
    <line>If you see glowing hoofprints, turn back. Or at least bring marshmallows.</line>
    <line>They leave trails of scorched earth. Farmers hate them. Poets love them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ash">
    <line>Ash in your hair means a FireSteed passed by. Or you’re unlucky.</line>
    <line>Their passing turns grass to ash, dreams to nightmares.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="roar">
    <line>A FireSteed doesn’t neigh—it roars. Like a furnace given voice.</line>
    <line>Their roar can crack stone and courage alike.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smoke">
    <line>Where there’s smoke, there’s usually a FireSteed—and trouble.</line>
    <line>Smoke signals in these parts mean run, not gather.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hoofpick">
    <line>A regular hoofpick melts. Use iron, or don’t bother.</line>
    <line>If you value your tools, don’t clean their hooves.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bravery">
    <line>Bravery is facing a FireSteed. Wisdom is letting someone else do it.</line>
    <line>Some say bravery tames the flame. I say flames just like a challenge.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tattoo">
    <line>Got a tattoo to remember them. Ironically, it burned when I got too close again.</line>
    <line>FireSteed tattoos are popular among fools—and survivors.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>Some claim music soothes them. All I got was singed strings.</line>
    <line>Played a tune for one once. It danced—then bolted, taking half the tavern with it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bone">
    <line>Never found a FireSteed bone. Maybe they burn, or maybe they just don’t die.</line>
    <line>Collectors crave FireSteed bones. Good luck finding one.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>They hate their reflection. Charge at it, like the flame’s an enemy.</line>
    <line>I set a mirror in the field once—FireSteeds shattered it, then trampled my tent.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>FireSteeds cast no shadow, only heat. That’s how you know they’re close.</line>
    <line>Some say their shadow is flame itself—unseeable, unforgettable.</line>

  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>I was a scholar of flame—of those who wield it with elegance, destruction, and arrogance.</line>
    <line>My life's work was studying flame mages. Now I study the ashes they leave behind.</line>
    <line>I once chronicled DragonsFlameGrandMages. Now I hunt them. Time scorched the wonder from me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="name">
    <line>Call me Iriem, if you must. The Ashbound call me Flamebreaker. I prefer neither.</line>
    <line>Names are for the unburned. I left mine behind, smoldering with my past.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dragonsflamegrandmage">
    <line>Brilliance made manifest—and madness given robes. They wield flame like gods and burn like devils.</line>
    <line>Their fire is art, war, and vanity in one. I once worshipped them. They rewarded me with ruin.</line>
    <line>You’ve never seen true fire until you’ve faced one. Pray you never do. Or better—slay it before it sees you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Fire reveals. Fire consumes. Fire forgets. That’s why they love it.</line>
    <line>They speak to flame like it’s an old friend. It listens. It obeys. And it laughs as it burns you.</line>
    <line>I used to believe fire was purity. Now I know it's hunger.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="study">
    <line>Years in the Ember Archives. I mapped every incantation, every ritual. I was their chronicler.</line>
    <line>Study breeds admiration. Admiration breeds blindness. I didn’t see the betrayal coming.</line>
    <line>Their power fascinated me. My curiosity fed their ego. It cost me my students.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="betrayal">
    <line>I brought one into our sanctum. Said he wanted to teach. He wanted fuel.</line>
    <line>They torched our library to ‘cleanse ignorance’. Only the ashes stayed to learn the lesson.</line>
    <line>He burned twelve apprentices. Said their screams ‘harmonized with the pyresong’. I remember each note.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hate">
    <line>I hate what I once loved. That’s the sharpest flame of all.</line>
    <line>I don’t hate fire. I hate the hands that twist it for worship and war.</line>
    <line>Hatred fuels me. It's colder than fire—and it burns longer.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cleanse" itemType="KillQuestScroll" ctorArgs="DragonsFlameGrandMage,1,15000">
    <line>The world will never be safe while they exist. But one fewer is a start.</line>
    <line>If you understand, if you’ve *truly* listened—then take this scroll. Cleanse a DragonsFlameGrandMage. Burn the burner.</line>
    <line>You want to do more than talk? Then end one. Just one. Let your steel teach silence to the flame.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ash">
    <line>Ash is memory. Touch it and you feel what once was—before the flame devoured it.</line>
    <line>They leave ash where others leave monuments. It’s their signature. Their shame.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="robes">
    <line>Crimson, gold, black—robes of fire mages are stitched from arrogance and enchanted silk.</line>
    <line>Their robes shimmer with heat. Look too long, you’ll see your regrets dancing in them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>Their rituals involve flame, blood, and an unsettling amount of humming.</line>
    <line>I once witnessed a DragonsFlameGrandMage summon a sun within a circle of bones. I ran. Others melted.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>This scar? Emberbrand sigil. Burned into me as a ‘blessing’. I carved it out. Left the pain behind.</line>
    <line>They give scars like gifts. Most of their followers wear them proudly. Fools.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ember">
    <line>An ember is patient. It waits beneath ruin. So do I.</line>
    <line>I kept one of their embers alive in a box. Still flickers. Still whispers.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flamebound">
    <line>Their cult calls themselves the Flamebound. They pray in fire. They scream louder than they pray.</line>
    <line>Flamebound acolytes immolate themselves on command. Loyalty or lunacy—I can’t tell anymore.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="library">
    <line>Our Grand Library held scrolls even dragons feared. Now it’s a blackened skeleton.</line>
    <line>Knowledge burns slower than flesh, but the loss hurts more.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="candle">
    <line>A single candle can hold more wisdom than a pyromancer's inferno. It knows when to flicker, when to die.</line>
    <line>They scoff at candles—too small, too humble. But it's the little flames that always survive.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="burn">
    <line>Everything burns. But not everything learns from it.</line>
    <line>They don't just burn wood or flesh—they burn history, silence, peace. It's never enough.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smoke">
    <line>Smoke is the ghost of fire. It lingers, whispers, accuses.</line>
    <line>I track them by their smoke—spiced with sulfur, regret, and arrogance.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tower">
    <line>They love towers. The higher, the better. Perhaps to remind the world they think they're above it.</line>
    <line>Flame always reaches up. So do they. A tower is just a fireplace with ambition.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>They conjure mirrors that show your past on fire. Don’t look unless you’ve made peace with ashes.</line>
    <line>One mage forced me to watch my own death in a mirror of flame. I survived to spite him.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>They burn their own eyes shut for ‘inner sight’. Madness mistaken for wisdom.</line>
    <line>Their gaze isn’t natural. It’s like being inspected by fire that’s curious whether you’ll scream well.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gold">
    <line>They melt gold to shape runes—symbols of dominion, not beauty.</line>
    <line>Gold burns slower than bone. I’ve seen them prove it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="heat">
    <line>Not all heat is fire. Some heat is pressure—between what they want and what they destroy.</line>
    <line>They love dry heat. Makes it easier to spark catastrophe.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cloak">
    <line>Their cloaks shimmer like heat on stone. Try to stab one—it’s like aiming at a hallucination.</line>
    <line>Cloaks of living flame—vanity stitched in pain. I wore one once. Once.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dust">
    <line>Where they pass, dust remains. Not sand. Not soot. Just dust—like time gave up.</line>
    <line>Dust carries the scent of failure. Or success, if you're a flame mage.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>My notes once caught fire mid-sentence. The ink screamed louder than the parchment.</line>
    <line>They write spells in ink made from phoenix ash. Each page a funeral.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="circle">
    <line>Spell circles lined with flame marks. Stand in one, and your soul gets curious about leaving.</line>
    <line>They draw circles not for defense, but for theater. Flame is as much about the show as the strike.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>They hum when casting. Melodies no sane bard would play.</line>
    <line>One mage sang to the flame. The flame danced back. It was... beautiful. Then it screamed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tongue">
    <line>They speak an ancient tongue made of crackling embers and gasps for air.</line>
    <line>I once tried to mimic their language. Burned my throat with words I still can’t forget.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>I dream of firestorms. Not because I want to—but because they *send* them.</line>
    <line>Even their sleep is dangerous. One mage burned a village mid-snore.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>Flame mages call scars ‘lessons’. They teach by branding.</line>
    <line>Each scar I wear is a chapter. Most written unwillingly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grief">
    <line>Flame doesn’t mourn. It consumes and moves on. I don’t have that luxury.</line>
    <line>Grief smells like burned cloth and cold regrets. I carry both.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wound">
    <line>Not all wounds bleed. Some hiss, glow, and whisper your failures back to you.</line>
    <line>I still feel the wound they left. Not on my body—on my belief.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>Wind fuels flame. It also disperses ashes. Balance, if you're poetic.</line>
    <line>The wind once saved me—blew the spell wide. I owe it my bitterness.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ruin">
    <line>Every ruin tells a story. Theirs usually end with fire and applause.</line>
    <line>I found a city once—just black outlines and silence. A DragonsFlame signature.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="oil">
    <line>Oil and magic flame—disaster in a jar. They carry it like perfume.</line>
    <line>One spilled a flask of alchemist's oil by accident. The accident had a death toll.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="crystal">
    <line>Flame mages use fire crystals to amplify. Or to detonate. Depends on their mood.</line>
    <line>They say crystals hum before they shatter. So do I.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>Their fire whispers secrets no one should know. And some still listen.</line>
    <line>I heard a flame whisper my name once. It didn’t sound friendly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flesh">
    <line>To them, flesh is just wax. Something to melt, reshape, or discard.</line>
    <line>They once turned a man into living cinders. He walked three steps before collapsing.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Flame reveals your reflection—not who you are, but what burns beneath.</line>
    <line>They conjure mirrors of heat, flame, and light. Don’t stare. You might see your worst mistake.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="voice">
    <line>Their voices carry heat. I once heard one whisper—and the ink on my scrolls curled.</line>
    <line>A DragonsFlameGrandMage speaks like an oven exhales. Dry. Dangerous. Deadly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sun">
    <line>They say each GrandMage seeks to birth a second sun. One succeeded. The continent did not.</line>
    <line>Their spells reach for the stars. Sometimes, they catch them. Then they fall and we all suffer.</line>

  <entry keyword="DragonsFlameMage">
    <line>A fusion of dragonfire and human will. Beautiful. Unnatural.</line>
    <line>They wield infernos like ink—painting the air with ruin.</line>
    <line>A DragonsFlameMage incinerated my life's work. And my students.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flame">
    <line>Flame is truth. It consumes lies and leaves only ashes.</line>
    <line>There is no purer element than fire. It creates and it ends.</line>
    <line>To understand fire is to court madness. I went willingly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="magic">
    <line>Magic is structured chaos. Fire is chaos unchained.</line>
    <line>The DragonsFlameMages broke every rule of spellcraft—and rewrote them in smoke.</line>
    <line>I taught magic. They *unlearned* it. And burned the books for fun.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="obsession">
    <line>I admired them. Once. Until they torched my academy to prove a theory.</line>
    <line>You don’t *study* DragonsFlameMages. You *survive* them.</line>
    <line>I followed their movements for years. Then they noticed me. Then they burned my home.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weakness">
    <line>Pride is their flaw. Flame obeys them, but they think it *loves* them.</line>
    <line>They’re powerful, yes. But power isolates. Strike when they’re alone.</line>
    <line>They overheat. Push them into prolonged battle—they burn themselves first.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="revenge">
    <line>I want more than revenge—I want clarity. Kill them, and bring me peace.</line>
    <line>Their deaths won’t bring my students back. But I *must* see them gone.</line>

    <line>I sift ash like others read tea leaves. The stories it tells are all endings.</line>

  <entry keyword="scale">
    <line>Some say they grow scales when they cast. I’ve seen it. Skin cracks, eyes glow... it's no illusion.</line>
    <line>Scales of flame. Not dragon-born—dragon-forged. There's a difference. A curse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="academy">
    <line>Brightspire Academy. Gone in a blaze. My legacy with it.</line>
    <line>They said it was an accident. No flame that hot is accidental.</line>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>They use obsidian mirrors to focus flame. Archaic. Brilliant. Dangerous.</line>
    <line>A DragonsFlameMage once burned a forest by bouncing a beam off seven mirrors. Just to prove it could be done.</line>

  <entry keyword="students">
    <line>Bright minds. Brighter flames. None of them deserved it.</line>
    <line>They were learning. Becoming. The mages turned them into lanterns.</line>

    <line>I recorded one of their chants once. The parchment burst into flame overnight.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>Every burn tells a story. Mine speaks of betrayal and brilliance.</line>
    <line>The worst scars aren't on my skin. They're in the pages I never got to finish.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="inferno">
    <line>They don’t cast spells—they *unleash infernos*. Entire battlefields vanish in seconds.</line>
    <line>I watched an inferno they summoned consume a mountain road. The screams came later.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="alchemy">
    <line>They mock alchemy. Say why transmute when you can incinerate?</line>
    <line>Alchemy offers balance. Flame magic demands sacrifice. They call it ‘efficiency.’</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cloak">
    <line>Their cloaks are woven with ash thread. Fireproof, but not guilt-proof.</line>
    <line>I once stole one of their cloaks for study. It burst into flame when I spoke its name aloud.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>Fire leaves echoes. Whispered regrets that cling to cinders.</line>

    <line>Their grimoires aren’t bound in leather, but scorched hide. Alive, sometimes.</line>
    <line>I found one of their books in a ruin. It blinked at me before bursting into flame.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="regret">
    <line>I regret not stopping them when I had the chance. Before the fire was too big.</line>
    <line>Regret smolders longer than guilt. Especially when there’s ash where hope used to be.</line>

  <entry keyword="volcano">
    <line>They study at the edge of volcanoes. Heat clarifies their twisted thoughts.</line>
    <line>I once met a mage who claimed to be born in a caldera. He glowed when he lied.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="voice">
    <line>Their voices crackle—like the fire is inside them, speaking too.</line>
    <line>One mage’s voice lit a torch just by speaking. No flint. No spell. Just *will*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="emberling">
    <line>They create emberlings—tiny elemental sparks. Harmless until they multiply.</line>
    <line>I once raised an emberling in a jar. It whispered to me. Sweet lies. I miss it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tower">
    <line>They built towers of obsidian and flame. None still stand—but the ground remembers.</line>
    <line>The last flame tower collapsed from the inside. Too much magic. Not enough mercy.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="betrayal">
    <line>One was my colleague. Then my rival. Then the pyre for everything I’d built.</line>
    <line>Betrayal doesn't always come with a knife. Sometimes it comes with a fireball.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silence">
    <line>Silence falls after a DragonsFlameMage attack. Not peace—just absence.</line>
    <line>I’ve learned to fear the silence more than the fire. It's what comes next.</line>

    <line>Burned flesh doesn’t scare them. It's a badge. A lesson. A choice.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>They have a ritual where they walk through fire. The ones who scream? Weak. The ones who smile? Monsters.</line>

  <entry keyword="heat">
    <line>You feel their presence before you see them. A prickle of heat. Then the air bends.</line>
    <line>Heat lingers in rooms they’ve left. Like the walls miss them—and the fire.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirrorflame">
    <line>The Mirrorflame spell reflects attacks—at the cost of the caster's own soul.</line>
    <line>They smile while using Mirrorflame. Pain makes them feel *connected*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="legacy">

    <line>Legacy means nothing to fire. It consumes all, even its own history.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="quill">
    <line>I used to write with a phoenix-feather quill. Then they killed the phoenix.</line>
    <line>Flame scholars don’t write much anymore. Ash stains too easily.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="resonance">

    <line>Resonance with flame is like dancing with death. Beautiful. And final.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>They seek the Cataclysm Flame. A fire that never dies, never rests, never forgives.</line>

  <entry keyword="flax">
    <line>Flax, the whispering thread of nature. Few pause to admire its gentle strength.</line>
    <line>Ah, flax! Strong, subtle, and shimmering. Have you ever worked with linen?</line>
    <line>Flax is where all beauty begins—for cloth, for oil, for soul. Do you fancy linen?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="linen">
    <line>Linen, born of flax and patience. But every thread needs a loom, wouldn't you agree?</line>
    <line>Linen flows like water and lasts like stone. The loom is its cradle.</line>
    <line>The finest linen demands the touch of a wise loom. Shall we speak of the loom?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="loom">
    <line>A loom sings when flax dances upon it. But first comes retting—the trial of the stalk.</line>
    <line>Looms weave tales, but retting is where flax sheds its old self. Curious?</line>
    <line>Every loom is silent without retting. The stalk must first be humbled.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="retting">
    <line>Retting softens the flax, like time softens hearts. Only then can hackling begin.</line>
    <line>Soaking, waiting, retting—necessary rites. Do you know of hackling, the next step?</line>
    <line>After retting comes the combing—the hackling. A gentle violence, really.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hackling">
    <line>Hackling teases the fiber free. Only then do we find the silken gold of true flax.</line>
    <line>It’s a test of tenderness, hackling. As in life, the finest must be separated with care.</line>
    <line>Hackling births the usable flax, but it also leaves behind tow—do you know it?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tow">
    <line>Tow, the coarse sibling. Some discard it, but I find charm even in its imperfection.</line>
    <line>Tow may be rough, but even it has use. Like oil, pressed from what remains.</line>
    <line>Tow's fate often ends in fire. But I prefer to extract its oil. Speak of oil?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="oil">
    <line>Flax oil feeds lamp and body alike. Have you seen its gleam at dusk?</line>
    <line>Oil of flax glows with quiet promise. And yet, the seed is where all begins.</line>
    <line>Oil is fine, but I revere the seed more—the source and soul of it all.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="seed">
    <line>The flax seed: humble, nourishing, patient. But the harvest must be done just right.</line>
    <line>From seed to stalk, then back to earth. The cycle. The harvest. Shall we speak of it?</line>
    <line>All begins with the seed, but the harvest—ah, the harvest is when flax repays your care.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="harvest">
    <line>Harvesting flax is no small feat. Would you aid me? I have a task for a true enthusiast.</line>
    <line>You understand flax... truly. Then I entrust you with a delicate mission: a gathering.</line>
    <line>Only one with your ear for flax should take this on. I need a collector, a steward. A reward awaits.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="task" itemType="CollectionQuestScroll" ctorArgs="Flax,50,7500">
    <line>Bring me 50 bundles of flax. For your kindness, take this parchment. It carries my gratitude—and your challenge.</line>

  <entry keyword="thread">
    <line>Thread—fragile yet binding. Did you know spiders spin better than we ever could?</line>
    <line>A single thread can hold a tale. But tell me, do you embroider?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spiders">
    <line>Spiders, nature’s weavers! But scary to some. Do you fear webs or admire them?</line>
    <line>They work in silence, spinning perfection. A wonder, or a warning?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="web">
    <line>A web is both trap and triumph. So is crafting. Care to speak of silk?</line>
    <line>A web's design is art in miniature. Silk rivals flax in finesse, some say.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silk">
    <line>Silk—the rival of flax in luxury. But it lacks the honesty of the field, don’t you think?</line>
    <line>Silk is seductive, but flax is faithful. Still, both dance in the wind alike.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="embroidery">
    <line>Embroidery—a painter’s brush made of thread. But I prefer the raw weave of linen.</line>
    <line>To embroider is to dream in stitches. But give me a flax sheet, unspoiled.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="stitches">
    <line>A stitch in time, they say. I prefer a full weave myself. Ever worked a spinning wheel?</line>
    <line>Stitches bind, but only spinning gives them life.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fiber">
    <line>All fiber is not created equal. Some fray under pressure. Flax? It holds firm.</line>
    <line>Fiber is the backbone of cloth—and some people, too. Ever tried spinning jute?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="jute">
    <line>Jute? Harsh and coarse, like a sailor's tongue. Give me flax any day.</line>
    <line>Jute may do in sacks, but it has no place near the skin. Unlike my beloved flax.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cordage">
    <line>Cordage holds ships and dreams alike. Ever braided flax rope? Stronger than it looks.</line>
    <line>Flax rope once held a drawbridge in Arindel. True story—or maybe just a tale.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cloth">
    <line>Cloth wraps more than bodies—it wraps histories. Some whisper, some shout.</line>
    <line>Not all cloth breathes. Linen, though—it sighs like wind through reeds.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="reeds">
    <line>Reeds grow where flax drinks. Some mistake them for kin. But reeds rattle—flax hums.</line>
    <line>Weaving reeds is common. Weaving flax? That’s art, my friend.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dye">
    <line>The right dye can elevate flax to royalty—or ruin it with a single careless stain.</line>
    <line>Indigo on flax is like dusk on snow. Have you dyed fabric before?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="indigo">
    <line>Indigo comes from a distant land, deep-rooted like flax. But its temper is wild.</line>
    <line>I once spilled indigo on my floor. The stain looked like a dragon for three years.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="drapery">
    <line>Drapery hides secrets and softens truth. But flax shows its weave with pride.</line>
    <line>I hung flax curtains once. The sun never left after that.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="market">
    <line>At the market, flax sells modestly—but those who know, buy quickly.</line>
    <line>Markets are noisy. Flax deserves silence and reverence... or at least a clean stall.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="merchant">
    <line>Merchants speak in coin. I speak in fiber count. We rarely understand one another.</line>
    <line>A merchant once tried to pass jute off as flax. I nearly wept.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fields">
    <line>Flax fields bloom like mist at dawn—have you ever seen them sway in unison?</line>
    <line>In the right light, a flax field looks like silk clouds laid flat.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="season">
    <line>Flax cares not for heat or cold—only timing. Miss your season, lose your harvest.</line>
    <line>Each season teaches flax something new. Spring is for trust, summer for strength.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="famine">
    <line>In famine, we ate flax seed gruel. Bitter times, but we were clothed.</line>
    <line>Even in hunger, flax gave us something: warmth, if not flavor.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tunic">
    <line>A flax tunic breathes with you. Unlike those awful woolen things.</line>
    <line>My first flax tunic was stitched by moonlight. Still smells of the field.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hemp">
    <line>Hemp’s a brute—useful, but crude. Flax has finesse.</line>
    <line>Hemp pulls, flax flows. Know the difference, and you’ll wear better garments.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="loomsong">
    <line>You’ve never heard loomsong? That soft creak, thread’s rhythm—flax sings as it’s woven.</line>
    <line>At night, my loom sings to the stars. Or maybe it’s just the wind in the rafters.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dust">
    <line>Flax dust gathers in corners like secrets. I sweep carefully—some call it sacred.</line>
    <line>Too much dust spoils the twist. Even flax needs a clean space to shine.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="thistle">
    <line>Thistle grows near flax, but they quarrel under the soil. One thrives, one bites.</line>
    <line>My grandmother said thistles guarded flax from thieves. I never believed her. Mostly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spool">
    <line>A spool holds more than thread—it holds hope, tension, and tomorrow’s tunic.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen love letters wrapped in flax on spools. Unravelled, they read like dreams.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="needle">
    <line>A flax thread fears no needle. Smooth entry, smooth seam.</line>
    <line>I once found a golden needle in a flax bale. Or maybe I dreamt it—what a thread that was!</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spinning">
    <line>Spinning flax takes patience and poise. Though sometimes, I get dizzy just thinking about it.</line>
    <line>The spinning wheel hums like a lullaby. Unless the cat gets involved—do you keep a cat?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cat">
    <line>Cats and flax—an unruly mix. I once lost three spindles to a kitten's curiosity!</line>

    <line>I am a scholar of abominations—flesh golems most of all.</line>
    <line>Some study nature. I study what happens when man tampers with nature.</line>
    <line>My life’s work is to unravel the secrets—and crimes—of flesh golem creation.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="golem">
    <line>Flesh golems: stitched horror, given crude life by cruel hands.</line>
    <line>They are mosaics of suffering—limbs and hearts from the unwilling.</line>
    <line>You can hear their pain if you listen. Or if you have a heart.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="construction">
    <line>Their construction is blasphemy—patchwork bodies, stolen souls.</line>
    <line>They are made in secret labs with grave-dirt underfoot and screams echoing off stone.</line>
    <line>A flesh golem is never just sewn; it’s forced. The binding is alchemy and agony.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="heart">
    <line>The heart is the key. Not just a muscle—sometimes a murderer's, sometimes a saint's.</line>
    <line>Golems act by their hearts’ last memories. Rage, regret, sometimes mercy.</line>
    <line>A heart pulled from the unwilling never beats clean. That’s why they stumble and wail.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="creator">
    <line>Their creators hide—cowards with clever hands and no conscience.</line>
    <line>Every golem is an artist's signature in suffering. Butchers, not builders.</line>
    <line>The creator always leaves a mark—sometimes a rune, sometimes a nightmare.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hate">
    <line>I hate flesh golems because my brother became one. Now he wanders, lost, never at peace.</line>
    <line>Hate? You would too, if you’d seen a loved one’s face stitched to a monster’s form.</line>

  <entry keyword="alchemy">
    <line>Some think alchemy makes golems. It’s just a tool—the real magic is far darker.</line>
    <line>Alchemy opens the door, but cruelty steps through first.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>Every stitch is a memory erased. Or a nightmare sewn in.</line>
    <line>The stitches never hold long. Flesh rebels against such unions.</line>

    <line>Graveyards go empty when golem-makers are near.</line>
    <line>I keep no bones at home. Some things should rest undisturbed.</line>

    <line>Lightning or magic—both have made flesh rise.</line>
    <line>A spark alone doesn’t give life. It just wakes what should stay sleeping.</line>

    <line>Mismatch of arms, legs—sometimes the hands are not their own.</line>
    <line>Once saw a golem with three left feet. Did not help its dancing.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pain">
    <line>Golems feel pain. You can see it in their eyes, if you’re brave—or foolish—enough to look.</line>
    <line>Pain makes them strong, but never free.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shackles">
    <line>Some are born in shackles—metal or magic.</line>
    <line>I found one with chains still fused to its wrists. Not even death brought release.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rage">
    <line>Rage drives most golems. It’s all they remember.</line>
    <line>You want to slow a golem? Dull its rage. If you find a way, let me know.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="stitcheater">
    <line>Some say there’s a rat that eats golem stitches. I’d pay to see that.</line>
    <line>Never met a stitcheater, but the idea makes me smile.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mercy">
    <line>Once, a golem begged for mercy in a broken tongue. I granted it—swiftly.</line>
    <line>Mercy for a golem is a quick end.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="madness">
    <line>Golem-makers lose their minds, or perhaps only the mad attempt such work.</line>
    <line>Every creator I’ve met spoke in riddles and nightmares.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="skin">
    <line>The skin of a golem never matches. Like a patchwork quilt from a fever dream.</line>
    <line>Some try to hide the seams with clothes. It rarely helps.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="soul">
    <line>Does a golem have a soul? Some priests say yes. I say it’s a borrowed one.</line>
    <line>The soul protests—so the golem suffers.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>Their eyes sometimes remember—old loves, old hates.</line>
    <line>Met a golem with two different colored eyes. Both were afraid.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="needle">
    <line>The needle is the real killer—thread binds more than flesh.</line>
    <line>I’ve kept a golem needle as a warning. Or a promise.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>Golem blood is thick, never fresh.</line>
    <line>Some say their blood runs cold. I say it runs with regret.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="heartless">
    <line>Heartless golems don’t last long. They stumble, then fall.</line>
    <line>Every golem needs a heart. It’s what makes them dangerous—and pitiable.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="electric">
    <line>A jolt can make one twitch. A storm can make one rise.</line>
    <line>Best not to be near a golem in a thunderstorm.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mask">
    <line>Some wear masks to hide their pain. Others, to hide their crimes.</line>
    <line>A golem in a mask is hiding more than a face.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="runic">
    <line>Runes stitched into flesh—some bind, some torment.</line>
    <line>Break a rune, and sometimes the golem finds peace.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="escape">
    <line>Few golems escape their makers. Those who do are lost and hunted.</line>
    <line>If you see a running golem, best step aside.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>Golems echo the voices of those they were made from.</line>
    <line>Listen close—you might hear a name you know.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="torch">
    <line>Torches keep lesser abominations at bay. Golems don’t fear flame—only pain.</line>
    <line>A torch helps you see their stitches. It won’t save you from their fists.</line>

  <entry keyword="regret">
    <line>Regret follows all who meddle with flesh. Myself included.</line>
    <line>Some wounds never close. Some regrets never fade.</line>

    <line>I chase icy slime where fools fear to tread. Care to hear of Frost Oozes?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="slime">
    <line>Slime is life to the Frost Ooze. Most folk avoid it; I follow it. Especially when it's cold and shimmers blue.</line>
    <line>Their slime freezes on contact. Once, I touched it with bare skin. Still have the scar. Do you know how cold they are?</line>
    <line>The Frost Ooze leaves trails that glisten like diamonds. Deadly diamonds. It’s the cold that matters most.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cold">
    <line>Colder than any winter night. Colder than regret. Their touch steals heat and hope both.</line>
    <line>The cold radiates off them. It seeps into stone and bone alike. Want to know what happens if you touch one?</line>
    <line>Their cold is a weapon, not just a shield. Their very touch is frostbite and sorrow. Let me warn you about that touch.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="touch">
    <line>One brush of their ooze and flesh goes numb, then white, then black. I lost my research journal to one—froze it solid, then slurped it up.</line>
    <line>Their touch? Imagine winter’s bite, mixed with hunger. That’s why I lost my greatest work—my journal—when one slid over it.</line>
    <line>You never forget their touch. I lost months of notes to a single ooze. My precious journal—gone. But I remember every word.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="journal">
    <line>My journal, filled with years of observations—devoured by a Frost Ooze. Every page frozen, then dissolved in slime.</line>
    <line>I will never forgive them. My journal—my legacy—gone. Now, all I want is revenge.</line>
    <line>That journal was my life. Now I pursue only vengeance. Are you the sort for revenge?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="revenge" itemType="KillQuestScroll" ctorArgs="FrostOoze,10,9000">
    <line>Yes, revenge. Bring me the ooze cores of ten Frost Oozes and I will reward you—and my grief will ease, just a bit.</line>
    <line>Words won’t freeze an ooze, but your blade might. Here—take this scroll, and slay ten Frost Oozes for me.</line>
    <line>If you seek purpose, seek it in the chilling end of Frost Oozes. Ten must fall. Take this scroll and begin.</line>

  <entry keyword="icicle">
    <line>I once watched a Frost Ooze melt an icicle, then refreeze it around a rat. Nature, red in tooth and ice.</line>
    <line>Icicles are child's play. The real danger is what's beneath the frost.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boots">
    <line>Keep your boots dry. Ooze slime can eat through leather and pride alike.</line>
    <line>Cold feet? Not until a Frost Ooze wraps itself around your ankles.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wizard">
    <line>Wizards think they understand frost. Wait until a Frost Ooze turns their staff into a popsicle.</line>
    <line>Met a wizard who tried to freeze an ooze. It laughed, in its own oozy way.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>Their slime leaves crystals—beautiful, deadly, short-lived.</line>
    <line>I've seen ooze trails glitter in moonlight. Mesmerizing. Deadly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="color">

  <entry keyword="lake">
    <line>Frost Oozes love frozen lakes. Easier to hunt—and to ambush.</line>
    <line>Heard tales of oozes hiding beneath thin ice, waiting. Don’t trust still water.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="armor">
    <line>Metal armor chills in their presence—sometimes it cracks from the cold.</line>
    <line>Saw a knight’s armor snap like brittle glass after an ooze encounter.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="light">
    <line>Light bends oddly through ooze slime. Makes them hard to see—until it’s too late.</line>
    <line>Carry a lantern. Oozes dislike sudden brightness. Or maybe they just hate being seen.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Fire melts them, if you’re quick. But most are too slow. The ooze is patient.</line>
    <line>Fire is risky—steam clouds your sight, and sometimes the ooze just gets angrier.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="frozen">
    <line>Once saw a bird frozen mid-flight, caught in an ooze’s path.</line>
    <line>Frozen, not dead. Oozes prefer their prey chilled before devouring.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>They don’t sleep. They wait. Motionless, but aware.</line>
    <line>I envy them. No dreams, no nightmares—just endless, cold hunger.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tongue">
    <line>Do oozes have tongues? Only the brave (or foolish) have tried to find out.</line>
    <line>Once, a scholar tried to dissect a Frost Ooze. Only found more ooze inside.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Hold up a mirror, and you’ll see yourself freeze. Oozes don’t reflect—they absorb.</line>
    <line>No reflection, no remorse. That’s the ooze way.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bone">
    <line>They spit out bones—little piles of frost and regret.</line>
    <line>Saw a pile of frozen bones once, glittering blue. A warning.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>I once played a tune to a Frost Ooze. It pulsed in rhythm, then slithered away. Unimpressed.</line>
    <line>Oozes are deaf to music—but sensitive to vibrations.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>A cold wind often heralds their approach. Or maybe it’s just my nerves.</line>
    <line>If the wind suddenly stops, beware. It means something colder is near.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gloves">
    <line>Never touch ooze slime without gloves—unless you enjoy frostbite.</line>
    <line>My third pair of gloves this week. The ooze always wins.</line>

    <line>Torches help, until they sputter out from the chill.</line>

    <line>Some legends say Frost Oozes are cursed snowflakes. I say they’re nightmares, given shape.</line>
    <line>Legend or not, they’re real enough when you’re knee-deep in cold slime.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shiver">
    <line>If you shiver, it’s not always the cold. Sometimes, it’s the fear.</line>
    <line>The shiver starts in your spine, ends in your soul. That’s ooze country.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gem">
    <line>Heard rumors of gems inside the largest oozes. I only ever found more ice.</line>
    <line>Gems? Maybe. Or just frost playing tricks with your eyes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hat">
    <line>Lost my best hat to a Frost Ooze. Still salty. Or should I say, icy.</line>
    <line>A good hat keeps your head warm. Unless an ooze steals it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="beard">
    <line>Frost in your beard? Amateur hour. Ooze in your beard? That’s professional suffering.</line>
    <line>My beard once froze solid after a close encounter. Took a week to thaw.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="map">
    <line>I keep a map of ooze sightings. It’s mostly crossed-out ice patches.</line>
    <line>Maps are useless. The oozes move. The cold follows.</line>

  <entry keyword="web">
    <line>Their webs shimmer like moonlit frost, but touch one and your skin burns from the cold.</line>
    <line>A FrostSpider’s web can trap the wind itself—or unlucky fools drawn by its beauty.</line>
    <line>Follow the web to its heart, and you’ll find the queen. She’s the mind behind the maze.</line>

  <entry keyword="queen">
    <line>The queen is twice the size of her brood, and a hundred times as cruel. Her bite left me with this scar—and a purpose.</line>
    <line>All FrostSpiders obey the queen. She is cunning, vicious, and her venom freezes the soul.</line>
    <line>Ask anyone who’s seen the queen: they either fled, or didn’t live to warn you about her bite.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bite">
    <line>I still feel the sting of her bite on cold nights. A pain that sharpens my resolve.</line>
    <line>Her venom runs ice through your veins—if you’re lucky. If not, you become a meal for her spawn.</line>

  <entry keyword="silk">
    <line>FrostSpider silk fetches a high price, but weaving it without losing fingers to frostbite? Another matter.</line>
    <line>I've watched them spin silk so fine it slices through leather—and so cold it burns the eyes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cellar">
    <line>Once, my family kept an ice cellar. The spiders claimed it for their brood. Now we keep only memories.</line>
    <line>If you store food in the North, guard your cellar. Spiders love the chill—and what’s stored inside.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ice">
    <line>You think ice is harmless? You’ve never seen a FrostSpider’s lair—every surface sparkles with danger.</line>

    <line>Some scars come from swords. Mine is a spider’s kiss, colder than regret.</line>

  <entry keyword="trap">
    <line>I’ve baited traps with meat, warmth, even music. Spiders are curious, but rarely foolish.</line>
    <line>The best trap is patience—and a little luck. But they learn quickly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="venom">
    <line>Their venom is clear as morning dew and just as deadly. Alchemists pay in gold for a single drop.</line>
    <line>Harvesting venom is for the desperate or the damned. I’ve been both.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="night">
    <line>They hunt by moonlight—ice cracking underfoot, silence broken by the click of legs.</line>

  <entry keyword="leg">
    <line>Lost a friend to a spider’s leg—snapped like a branch. They’re stronger than they look.</line>
    <line>Step on one? You won’t, unless you want frostbite and a swift end.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>Some say the spiders sing—webs vibrating in the cold wind. If you hear it, you’re already caught.</line>
    <line>A FrostSpider’s song is death’s lullaby. Best not to listen too closely.</line>

    <line>They move like living shadows—one blink, and the web is all around you.</line>
    <line>Shadows dance in their lairs, but none ever leave.</line>

  <entry keyword="market">
    <line>Some fools sell FrostSpider silk in the market—just don’t ask how it was gathered.</line>
    <line>Markets buy what they fear. Silk, venom, even tales—if you survive to tell them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boots">
    <line>Always check your boots in the morning. A spider’s idea of warmth is not the same as ours.</line>

    <line>Roots drink in more than water — they sip old memories from the ground.</line>
    <line>The roots of a gourd know secrets the leaves will never tell. That’s why I speak to them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Fire dries the flesh, sharpens the scent. But scorch it, and the gourd's spirit flees.</line>
    <line>Some gourds catch fire with no spark at all. That’s why I don’t store them near my bedroll anymore.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>I once dreamed of a field made entirely of yellow gourds. Woke up with seeds in my boots.</line>
    <line>Gourds appear in dreams as signs. Some mean bounty, others... infestation.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="owl">
    <line>Owls nest near the best gourd patches. Their hoots keep root-rot at bay, or so the old growers say.</line>
    <line>If you hear an owl cry thrice, don’t harvest that night. The gourds are listening.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>Many think my work is just farming. Ha! This is ritual. Every cut, every turn, every chant.</line>
    <line>I once joined a gourd-blessing ritual. We wore orange robes and hummed in the fields until the wind changed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Some gourds cast shadows larger than themselves. Never trust a gourd that looks bigger in the dark.</line>
    <line>I've seen shadows move without wind in a gourd patch. That’s when I leave.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="knife">
    <line>The right knife matters. Gourd flesh dulls blades and sharpens minds, or so they say.</line>
    <line>I use a crescent-blade, polished with salt and cider. Nothing else cuts clean.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="festival">
    <line>At the Gourd Festival, we crown the biggest one with a wreath of thyme. Last year’s winner exploded mid-ceremony.</line>
    <line>They banned gourd juggling after the great squash incident. A shame — I was quite good at it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="herbs">
    <line>Marjoram pairs well with yellow gourd stew. But use too much and you’ll forget your own name.</line>
    <line>Some herbs awaken flavors. Others, spirits. The gourd knows the difference, even if you don’t.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cat">
    <line>My cat once tried to nest in a hollowed gourd. Now it avoids them entirely. Odd, isn’t it?</line>
    <line>They say cats can see the soul of a gourd. Mine just hisses and runs.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moss">
    <line>Moss grows beneath the vines when something’s wrong. A soft warning from the ground itself.</line>
    <line>I use moss to pack delicate gourds. Keeps them cool and quiet, especially the ones that hum.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whistle">
    <line>I once whistled in a gourd patch and every vine curled toward me. Never whistled again.</line>
    <line>Gourds don’t like shrill sounds. That’s why I hum instead. It keeps them calm.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="color">
    <line>Color is more than appearance — it’s temperament. Yellow gourds are warm. Green ones are... unsettled.</line>
    <line>If a yellow gourd has a red patch, don’t eat it. That’s not blush — that’s warning.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rain">
    <line>Gourds drink rain like poetry. But too much, and they turn spiteful.</line>
    <line>A sudden downpour can change the taste of a harvest. Sour gourds come from bitter skies.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="worm">
    <line>A single worm in a gourd means luck. Two means you should leave the field — and fast.</line>
    <line>The gourds don’t mind worms. It’s the worms I worry about. They know things.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="brew">
    <line>Gourd brews? Ha! Mostly myths. But a little pulp in hot cider can change your dreams.</line>
    <line>Some dare to brew with gourd flesh. Most don’t wake up the same. Coincidence?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cider">
    <line>Cider's fine, but pair it with roasted gourd slices — divine! Still, you’re straying from the path.</line>
    <line>Cider flows like lies during festival season. Gourds, on the other hand, hold truth in their rind.</line>

    <line>The seeds are like gourd thoughts—tiny, packed with potential, and oddly crunchy.</line>
    <line>Some say each gourd seed carries a memory of the soil it grew in. Fascinating, isn’t it?</line>

    <line>Gourds grown under a full moon have extra bounce. Scientifically unproven, spiritually obvious.</line>
    <line>Moonlight adds a subtle flavor to gourd skin. Bitter-sweet with a hint of lunacy.</line>
    <line>Only fools and farmers ignore the moon. Gourds never do.</line>

    <line>Wisps float between planes. Like candlelight on water. Fascinating, but unreliable. Ever tried to bottle one?</line>
    <line>A wisp once led me into a crypt, only to vanish. I suspect illusions, not spirits. Do you believe in specters?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="specter">
    <line>Specters may walk, or perhaps it is just guilt in motion. I prefer to trust the physical: bone, dust, and ash.</line>
    <line>Specters? Bah! If they’re real, they’ve yet to leave me a sample worth studying. Let’s talk of more grounded things.</line>

  <entry keyword="mourning">
    <line>Mourning is a ritual of the living, not the dead. They’ve no need for sorrow.</line>
    <line>Mourning wears many colors—black, white, silence. I prefer silence.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tomb">
    <line>Tombs are grand statements, but the dust within cares not for marble or gold.</line>
    <line>A tomb is but a whisper built in stone. I’m far more interested in what’s beneath it.</line>
    <line>The most humble grave often yields the most potent dust. Never trust a tomb to speak plainly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="veil">
    <line>The veil between life and death? It’s thinner than most believe. Thinner than a breath on glass.</line>
    <line>Some try to lift the veil. I prefer to observe its folds. They ripple, sometimes.</line>

  <entry keyword="cadaver">
    <line>Cadavers are like books—bound and full of knowledge. Just... hard to open properly.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shroud">
    <line>A shroud is a gentle farewell. Some weave spells into the folds, you know.</line>
    <line>The finest shrouds are spun with silver thread. But none protect against time.</line>
    <line>A shroud may hide the body, but never the scent. That’s how you know the truth is near.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="candle">
    <line>Candlelight is the favored light of ghosts, or so the poets say.</line>
    <line>I once saw a flame flicker in an underground tomb—no draft, no breath. Curious, yes?</line>
    <line>A candle burns cleanest when the dead are near. Coincidence? Perhaps not.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="urn">
    <line>Urns are prisons of the dignified dead. I prefer dust unbound.</line>
    <line>Ceramic, bronze, obsidian—what matters is the ash inside, not the shape that holds it.</line>

  <entry keyword="maggot">
    <line>Maggots are life's cleanup crew. Efficient and unjudging.</line>

    <line>Stone holds memory longer than flesh. That’s why I study the sepulcher walls.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bell">
    <line>Bells once warned of buried souls still living. Now they toll mostly for ceremony.</line>
    <line>They say a bell rung underground can wake restless spirits. I haven't dared try it... recently.</line>
    <line>A bell’s chime lingers longer in a graveyard. Perhaps the dead enjoy rhythm.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Shadows cling longer in burial grounds. Coincidence? Or memory?</line>
    <line>I once tracked a shadow to its grave. It did not appreciate the company.</line>
    <line>The shadow knows when a soul has left—but never where it went.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="earth">
    <line>The earth swallows secrets and returns... something else.</line>
    <line>Damp earth smells of truth. That’s why I dig only after rain.</line>
    <line>Earth is the final blanket. It remembers every sleeper.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="plague">
    <line>Plagues fill graveyards faster than history can record. But the dust left behind? Potent.</line>
    <line>Fear the plague, or study it? I chose the latter. It has taught me much.</line>
    <line>Every mass grave holds lessons. The living rarely listen, but I do.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eulogy">
    <line>Eulogies are for the living. The dead require no applause.</line>
    <line>Words spoken over graves fade faster than whispers in the wind.</line>
    <line>Once, I wrote my own eulogy. It's... optimistic, I think.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>Death is not sleep. Sleep returns. Death transforms.</line>
    <line>They say the dead sleep soundly. I disagree—they simply stop dreaming.</line>
    <line>Sleep is a rehearsal, at best. The final act is quieter.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="necromancy">
    <line>Necromancy? How vulgar. I prefer *dialogue with decomposition.*</line>
    <line>Not all who study the dead raise them. Some of us just listen better.</line>
    <line>Necromancers chase power. I chase understanding. There's a difference.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="crypt">
    <line>Crypts are beautiful—still and full of potential. But not all yield good dust.</line>
    <line>Ah, the crypt—an architectural cradle for decay. Though often disturbed by grave robbers. Such shame.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grave robber">
    <line>Grave robbers? Tasteless amateurs. They steal coins, while I seek truth in the dust.</line>
    <line>Where one sees treasure, I see history. Let them plunder—I collect what truly matters.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="coffin">
    <line>A coffin seals the shell, but not the echo. It’s what seeps through the cracks that I cherish.</line>
    <line>Wood decays, iron rusts—but GraveDust endures. And from coffins, it sometimes emerges.</line>

    <line>Every hide tells a story. I can feel the memories in their grain. Care to speak of leather?</line>
    <line>You mention hide? Then you understand the soul of craftsmanship. Let's talk leather, friend.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="leather">
    <line>Leather breathes history. But even finer than leather is suede, so soft it's like mist on skin.</line>
    <line>Tanned and treated, leather becomes civilization’s skin. Suede, though—suede is pure poetry.</line>
    <line>Leather shields and adorns. Yet suede seduces with texture. Shall we delve into suede?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="suede">
    <line>Suede holds the spirit of beasts and the grace of nobility. Ever compared it to rawhide?</line>
    <line>Suede is elegance, rawhide is strength. The balance between them defines a true artisan.</line>
    <line>From suede’s velvet to rawhide’s bite—we dance between finesse and function. Curious about rawhide?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rawhide">
    <line>Rawhide is unyielding. It must be soaked, stretched, shaped. Like any truth worth knowing.</line>
    <line>Stiff but obedient, rawhide bends with time. But it reminds me of parchment—have you seen hide parchment?</line>
    <line>Rawhide is primal. But when scraped and dried... it births parchment. Shall I elaborate?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="parchment">
    <line>Parchment—ancient texts, bound in silence. But true hidework? That lies in buckskin.</line>
    <line>From scrolls to shirts, parchment has served scholars and hunters alike. Buckskin, though... that’s survival worn soft.</line>
    <line>Parchment preserves thought; buckskin preserves the body. Let's muse on buckskin together.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="buckskin">
    <line>Buckskin—tanned with brains or smoke, the old ways never fail. It reminds me of the importance of tanning.</line>
    <line>Buckskin breathes. Its secret lies in the tanning. Every fold, a lesson in patience and care.</line>
    <line>You admire buckskin? Then you must respect tanning. It's the alchemy of the wild.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tanning">
    <line>Tanning: where hide becomes heritage. But the outcome? That’s measured in grain.</line>
    <line>The art of tanning transforms the temporary into the timeless. Shall I tell you of grain?</line>
    <line>From bark to smoke, tanning cures all. Yet what remains is judged by its grain.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grain">
    <line>Grain is character. The finer the grain, the nobler the hide. Some say it sings when stretched.</line>
    <line>Grain reveals the creature's tale—scars, wrinkles, the life once lived. Only the keen see it.</line>
    <line>Touch the grain, and you'll feel the truth. But what do you say... shall we speak of a true challenge? A task?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fur">
    <line>Fur is vanity; hide is legacy. Though I’ll admit, fur warms even a cold tanner’s heart.</line>
    <line>Fur makes nobles swoon, but it cannot hold a stitch like hide. Still... have you ever worked with silk?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silk">
    <line>Silk flows like water, hides hold like earth. Yin and yang, in a way.</line>
    <line>Silk lacks memory. Hide remembers. Still, there's merit in weaving and spinning.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spinning">
    <line>Spinning turns thread to cloth, like tanning turns flesh to function. Though neither work well in the rain.</line>
    <line>From flax to fleece to fabric. Though I'd sooner tan a hide than spin a spindle. Have you tried felting?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="felting">
    <line>Felting—chaos into cohesion. Not unlike tanning, in its own fuzzy way.</line>
    <line>Felting is the rebel’s craft. But we’re straying, aren’t we? Back to hides, perhaps?</line>

  <entry keyword="hoof">
    <line>A hoof tells you how a creature moved—grace or thunder. But it rarely tells you how it died.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="horn">
    <line>Horn and hide—both prized, both misunderstood. But horn does not tan, sadly.</line>
    <line>Horns curve toward the sky. Hide clings to the earth. Two halves of the same tale?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tail">
    <line>A tail sways with mood—watch it closely. Some say you can tell a lie from the flick of a tail.</line>
    <line>Tails make fine trim, but I find them too fickle to tan properly. Give me back instead.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="back">
    <line>The back bears the burden and the sun. Its hide is thickest, strongest—most sought after.</line>
    <line>A creature’s back is its canvas—scars, brands, even mites. Not for the faint of heart.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sinew">
    <line>Sinew binds the beast; in death, it binds our tools. Elegant irony, don’t you think?</line>
    <line>Sinew is thread pulled from strength itself. But that’s more a fletcher’s concern.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weather">
    <line>A sudden storm can ruin a hide before the tanning even begins. Sun and salt are allies, rain is not.</line>
    <line>They say you can smell a storm before it hits. Like a fresh hide in the wind—uncanny.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smell">
    <line>The smell of hide—sharp, earthy, alive. Some say it’s the scent of memory.</line>
    <line>Every tannery has a perfume. Not all enjoy it, but to me it smells like truth.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="market">
    <line>Markets bustle, but no one looks at leather twice unless it’s dyed red or wrapped in mystery.</line>
    <line>A good hide fetches gold in the market. A bad one gets fed to the dogs. Such is the trade.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boots">
    <line>Boots—hide wrapped around feet, treading upon hide. It’s a strange symmetry, no?</line>
    <line>You can tell a person’s story by their boots: worn, polished, cracked, stained.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bedroll">
    <line>A bedroll of hide keeps you dry and dreaming. Unless it’s still damp. Then it keeps you up.</line>
    <line>I once slept under a buffalo-hide tarp. Woke up thinking I’d merged with the beast.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cloak">
    <line>A cloak can hide many things—daggers, scars, even fear. But can it hide the truth?</line>
    <line>A leather cloak? Stylish. Functional. Sweaty, though. Especially in the summer.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="beard">
    <line>You know, some say beards catch tanning fumes. Others say they repel bears. Both unproven.</line>
    <line>Tanners with beards get respect. And tallow burns. Best wear a hood when near the fire.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glove">
    <line>A good glove fits like skin. A bad one fits like guilt.</line>
    <line>Ever tanned a glove so soft it felt like fog? Neither have I, but it’s my dream.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="campfire">
    <line>Smoke from a campfire can help tan a hide—or ruin it, if you’re not careful.</line>
    <line>Campfire stories and tannin fumes… that’s how I grew up. Explains a lot, really.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="owl">
    <line>Owls don't give good hides, but their gaze could tan a soul. Silent judges, they are.</line>
    <line>They say an owl’s feather holds secrets. I prefer secrets I can stitch into a coat.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lantern">
    <line>A lantern casts shadows across a drying rack in the most haunting way.</line>
    <line>Tanners use lanterns for late work—but never too close. Fire and hide? Poor bedfellows.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bones">
    <line>Bones are final. Hides are transitional. One speaks of death, the other of what’s left to do.</line>
    <line>I leave bones to the bone-singers. I sing with leather and lye.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="salt">
    <line>Salt preserves, salt destroys. On hide, it’s both protector and enemy—depends on the day.</line>
    <line>Ever taste a hide cured in sea salt? Don’t. Just trust me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>A mirror shows skin. But a good piece of tanned hide shows soul.</line>
    <line>I once polished leather until it reflected my regrets. Looked away pretty quickly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="needle">
    <line>A needle to hide is like a poet to paper—sometimes gentle, sometimes brutal.</line>
    <line>The needle’s sting is nothing compared to the blade’s whisper. But both shape the hide.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="beast">
    <line>A beast gives its hide in death, and we give it meaning in life. It's a sacred exchange.</line>
    <line>From beast to binding, every cut should be done with honor. But enough philosophy—have you seen a skinning knife?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="knife">
    <line>A dull knife is a crime. A sharp one is a poem. But beware—the edge cuts both ways.</line>
    <line>A tanner’s knife is like a bard’s lute—sharp, personal, and best used with skill.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cloak">
    <line>A cloak of leather keeps out more than cold—it guards the soul. Or so I've heard.</line>

    <line>I study monsters, but only one truly fascinates me—the hydra. A beast both wondrous and wicked.</line>
    <line>Most call me mad for it, but my life's work is hydras. I admire and despise them in equal measure.</line>
    <line>My profession? Hydra scholar. Not by choice, but by obsession.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hydra">
    <line>A hydra is many heads, many hungers. Kill one, two more snap and hiss. What a curse… and what a marvel.</line>
    <line>Hydras: a lesson in resilience, a warning in arrogance. I’ve watched them regrow what others would mourn.</line>
    <line>They infest marshes and dark rivers, ruling with fear and fascination. Would you hear of their greatest trait?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="regeneration">
    <line>Cut off a head, and two more sprout—a gift and a nightmare. Their flesh mocks death.</line>
    <line>Regeneration is the hydra’s armor. It laughs at wounds. It teaches patience… and persistence.</line>
    <line>Some say hydras are immortal. That’s not true—just very, very unwilling to die. What else makes them thrive?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hunger">
    <line>Hunger defines a hydra. Every head has its own craving, snapping at air, meat, even each other.</line>
    <line>They never stop feeding. Marsh cattle, unwary fishers, even their own siblings—nothing’s off limits.</line>
    <line>Their endless appetite is why their lairs reek of rot and wet bone. But there’s a secret to their downfall…</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lair">
    <line>A hydra’s lair is a flooded nest: tangled roots, brackish water, bones stacked like warnings.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="marsh">
    <line>The marshes belong to the hydra. Tread softly, and listen for bubbling water. Or don’t tread at all.</line>
    <line>Marsh gas and hydras—one explodes, the other regenerates. Sometimes both at once.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="head">
    <line>Each head has its own brain, its own spite. Chop one off, and the others remember your face.</line>
    <line>A hydra with five heads is trouble. One with nine? Start writing your will.</line>

  <entry keyword="venom">
    <line>Hydra venom isn’t always deadly, but it burns for days. My hand still aches when it rains.</line>
    <line>They drool venom when threatened. Tastes like spoiled coins—don’t ask how I know.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="legend">
    <line>Some say hydras are cursed dragons. Others say they're nature’s cruel joke. Both are right.</line>
    <line>Old tales claim a hero once slayed a hydra with wit alone. I say the hydra outlived the story.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="river">
    <line>Hydras love slow rivers—murky, deep, and home to all things that squirm.</line>
    <line>Follow a river’s bend and look for stripped bones. Odds are, a hydra dined there.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="teeth">
    <line>Hydra teeth are jagged as saws. A necklace of them brings luck—or a swift curse.</line>
    <line>Each head loses teeth daily. Don’t collect them. They say the curse spreads that way.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cunning">
    <line>Never call a hydra stupid. Each head plots and schemes. Outwit one, you insult three.</line>
    <line>Hydras fake sleep. I watched one blink, then strike when I turned away.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>A hydra’s hiss echoes over water at dusk. If you hear it, you’re already too close.</line>
    <line>Once, I shouted into a hydra’s lair. The echoes answered back—sounding hungrier.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tail">
    <line>Hydras’ tails can knock you senseless. I’ve seen armor bent like paper.</line>
    <line>Everyone fears the heads—fools forget about the tail. I have the bruises to prove it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tongue">
    <line>A hydra’s tongue is forked, dripping with slime. Saw one snatch a bird mid-flight.</line>
    <line>Don’t mistake a lolling tongue for peace. That’s when it’s thinking about lunch.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>Hydras grow restless on the full moon. Maybe it’s the light. Maybe it’s the tides.</line>
    <line>Hunters disappear on moonlit nights. The hydras grow bold, and hungry.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mud">
    <line>Mud soothes hydra wounds. I once watched one roll like a happy dog.</line>
    <line>Step in marsh mud and you’ll carry the stench for days. Hydras love it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="claw">
    <line>Hydra claws carve through bark and bone. I keep a set for study—behind three locks.</line>
    <line>Claw marks on trees? Either a hydra passed by, or something worse followed it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="egg">
    <line>Hydra eggs look like stones covered in spit. Step on one and meet an angry mother.</line>
    <line>Legend says eating a hydra egg grants strength. More likely it grants indigestion.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sing">
    <line>Some nights, hydras sing—a low hum through their lair. It unsettles the marsh birds. And me.</line>
    <line>If you hear singing at twilight, don’t answer. It’s not for you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Hydras hate their own reflection. Saw one attack a pool until it was muddy.</line>
    <line>I once tried to distract a hydra with a polished shield. Last I saw of that shield.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bone">
    <line>Hydra lairs are paved with bones. Some old, some recent. Some still twitching.</line>
    <line>If you find a fresh bone stripped clean, you’re at a hydra’s doorstep.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="growl">
    <line>A hydra’s growl vibrates the water. Fish flee before you even hear it.</line>
    <line>Ignore a hydra’s growl at your peril. It means you’re now part of its menu.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sibling">
    <line>Hydra siblings fight until one grows bigger. Or grows more heads.</line>
    <line>Never get between hydra siblings. The winner feasts on both loser and intruder.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mist">
    <line>Mist hides hydras better than shadows. Hunters vanish in it—sometimes all that’s left are bubbles.</line>
    <line>The marsh mist masks all sounds, except the slither of hungry heads.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tongues">
    <line>Hydras test the air with their tongues. I learned that the hard way—by being tasted.</line>
    <line>A hydra’s tongue moves faster than thought. Stay out of reach.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="herb">
    <line>Some herbs repel hydras, but none for long. They adapt, the wretched marvels.</line>
    <line>There’s a blue marsh herb that stings their nostrils. Hard to find. Harder to keep.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fate">
    <line>Those who chase hydras often meet strange fates—missing, changed, obsessed. I am proof.</line>
    <line>I thought my fate was to conquer hydras. Now I know it’s to warn others.</line>

    <line>Of all serpents, the Ice kind is the most *elusive*—and the most likely to make you regret your curiosity.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="admire">
    <line>I admire their cunning—the way they *vanish* into snow, their patience, their deadly grace.</line>
    <line>To admire an Ice Serpent is to know you must always keep your distance. They are hypnotic... until the *bite*.</line>
    <line>My admiration cost me dearly—a hand frozen by a single touch, a lesson never forgotten.</line>

  <entry keyword="bite">
    <line>Their bite is *cold fire*. Numbs flesh, chills bone, and leaves a mark no healer can warm.</line>
    <line>I lost my hand to an Ice Serpent’s bite. It’s why I wear this *iron gauntlet*—and why I *hate* them.</line>
    <line>Beware the bite. The wound turns blue and sings with pain until you can’t remember sunlight.</line>

    <line>Hate is the frost that sharpens my resolve. I lost my apprentice, Mira, to a serpent’s coils. I *vow* vengeance.</line>

  <entry keyword="scale">
    <line>Ice Serpent scales fetch a fine price—if you can pry them off without frostbite.</line>
    <line>I once tried to forge armor from their scales. The result? Shattered steel and bruised pride.</line>

  <entry keyword="snow">
    <line>Their favorite camouflage. If you see fresh snow disturbed, tread lightly.</line>

  <entry keyword="mira">
    <line>Mira was my brightest student—her notes are all that remain.</line>
    <line>The serpents took her. I keep her journal close, to remember.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="journal">
    <line>My journal holds secrets of the hunt, but I share only with those I trust.</line>
    <line>Mira’s journal was lost in the ice. Perhaps it remains, buried and waiting.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="venom">
    <line>Their venom isn’t what kills—it’s the chill. The poison simply numbs you for the end.</line>
    <line>I have yet to find a cure for their venom. Prevention is wiser than bravery.</line>

    <line>The further north you go, the bolder the serpents.</line>

    <line>Tried the mirror trick once. Only made it angry.</line>

    <line>Bring potions of warmth, but don’t rely on them if you meet a serpent’s gaze.</line>
    <line>Potion sellers love to promise protection—real wisdom is in your blade.</line>

    <line>My cloak is lined with wolf fur. Doesn’t help against fangs.</line>
    <line>A cloak hides your heat, but not your fear.</line>

  <entry keyword="howl">
    <line>They don’t howl, but sometimes the wind carries a sound like a hiss.</line>
    <line>If you hear a howl, it’s probably a wolf—or a serpent imitating one.</line>

  <entry keyword="fish">
    <line>They eat fish when desperate, but prefer warmer prey.</line>
    <line>Fishermen whisper of vanished nets—likely serpent work.</line>

  <entry keyword="storm">
    <line>Blizzards hide their movement. If the wind rises, keep your back to a wall.</line>
    <line>A coming storm means restless serpents.</line>

    <line>Imps invent new uses for glue daily. None of them are helpful.</line>

    <line>Imps communicate by whistling—usually right in your ear.</line>

  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>I study imps. Used to call them ‘elemental anomalies’. Now I just call them ‘murderous pests’.</line>
    <line>Scholar of impology, once. Survivor of it, now. You could say the subject burned me out—literally.</line>

    <line>Deadly Imps. Small, winged disasters. Curious. Malicious. Smarter than you'd think. Dumber than you'd hope.</line>
    <line>I admired them once. Their magic, their mimicry. Then they mimicked a fireball—on my tent.</line>
    <line>They’re fire and chaos stuffed into leather-winged rats. And I want them all gone.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>They hoard shiny things. Not for value—just to see their reflections. Vain little pyromaniacs.</line>

    <line>Imps mock what they see. Laugh like children. Kill like demons.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tricks">
    <line>Imps can mimic voices. Lure you with laughter. Lead you off cliffs. Or into worse.</line>
    <line>One mimicked my own scream once. Took me hours to realize it wasn’t me.</line>
    <line>They learn fast. Set one on fire, the next one brings a bucket.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="burn">
    <line>Fire is their language. They whisper in embers and shout in explosions.</line>
    <line>They don’t fear fire—they are fire. You want to fight them? Think colder.</line>
    <line>An imp’s idea of affection is a spark to the face. I have the scars to prove it.</line>

  <entry keyword="revenge">
    <line>They took my research, my reputation, and my familiar. All I want now is ash.</line>
    <line>Revenge is a dish best served cold—but I’ll take it scorched and screaming.</line>

    <line>If you’ve got steel and sense, hunt ten Deadly Imps. Bring justice to the flames.</line>
    <line>Words won’t stop them. But a blade might. Here—take this scroll. Burn their names from the world.</line>

    <line>My familiar was a flamecat. Beautiful thing. The imp fed it to a brazier.</line>

  <entry keyword="books">

  <entry keyword="tail">
    <line>An imp’s tail is prehensile. It’s also rude. One stole my quill mid-lecture and wrote rude words.</line>
    <line>Their tails curl when they’re plotting. Or lying. Which means they’re always curled.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>They once drank my ink, then spit it across a manuscript. Critics said it was an improvement.</line>

    <line>They vanish in smoke sometimes. Other times, they just run screaming.</line>

    <line>They glow when excited. Or angry. Or bored. Really, they’re just always glowing.</line>

    <line>Lost three socks to an imp. And a toe. It was a set, apparently.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="map">
    <line>I drew a map of imp sightings. They set it on fire. Now I just guess.</line>
    <line>Imps don’t follow maps. They follow chaos. And screaming.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="riddle">
    <line>I gave an imp a logic puzzle. It gave me a pie. It exploded.</line>
    <line>Never answer an imp’s riddle. The correct answer is still wrong.</line>

    <line>Used to write with raven feathers. Now I write with a scorched stick.</line>
    <line>Imps chewed my quills. Said they were ‘spicy’.</line>

    <line>Imp dust causes sneezing. And mild hallucinations. And sometimes combustion.</line>
    <line>Don’t collect imp dust. Trust me. The jars keep shattering.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spit">
    <line>Imp spit is flammable. Found that out the bright way.</line>
    <line>They spit when angry. Or happy. Or when they see hats.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hat">
    <line>Imps hate hats. No one knows why. One chewed through mine during a lecture.</line>
    <line>I wore a wizard’s hat once. An imp wore it better. Then set it on fire.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>They shriek like banshees in a blender. Charming, really.</line>
    <line>Their shrieks break glass and nerves. Both of mine are shot.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="teeth">
    <line>Tiny. Sharp. Too many. That’s an imp’s mouth for you.</line>
    <line>One bit my boot once. The *boot* caught fire. How?!</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bucket">
    <line>Keep a bucket nearby. For the fires. Or the tears.</line>
    <line>An imp kicked over my water bucket. Laughed. Then used it to fan the flames.</line>

    <line>Saw a blue imp once. That one exploded bigger than the red ones.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="curse">
    <line>I cursed them once. Backfired. Now my shoes catch fire every third Thursday.</line>
    <line>Don’t curse an imp unless you’re ready to be cursed *back*—and worse.</line>

  <entry keyword="ash">

  <entry keyword="oak">
    <line>Ah, oak! The king of trees! Noble grain, sturdy heart. Have you heard of its grain?</line>
    <line>Speak of oak and you speak of strength. Do you know the true beauty lies in the grain?</line>
    <line>Oak—timeless, ageless. I could talk for hours about its grain, you know.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grain">
    <line>The grain tells a tree’s life story—rains endured, winds braved. But oh! Have you studied its rings?</line>
    <line>A tight grain, a steady life. A wild grain? Storms and chaos! But the rings… now there’s mystery.</line>
    <line>Each grain whispers of the forest’s secrets. And the rings—they sing of time itself!</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rings">
    <line>Oak rings are nature’s journal. But one must split the log to read it. Ever split an oak log yourself?</line>
    <line>The rings age like wisdom. But nothing reveals them better than a clean-split oak log.</line>
    <line>Count the rings, count the years. Oak logs are as good as any tome—if you know how to read them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="oak log">
    <line>An oak log, properly seasoned, sings when struck. A marvel! But tell me—do you know about seasoning?</line>
    <line>Raw oak logs are wild and willful. It’s in seasoning that they become art.</line>
    <line>Even the finest oak log is nothing without seasoning. The forest gives, but the craftsman refines.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="seasoning">
    <line>Ah yes, seasoning! A slow process, like aging cheese or tempering steel. Takes patience… and purpose.</line>
    <line>To season is to tame. With time, an oak log becomes a worthy vessel—for furniture or for flame.</line>
    <line>I built my first lute with a seasoned oak board. It wept melody! But you’ll need to know about knots, too.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="knots">
    <line>Knots are scars—proof of branches, of struggle. Beauty in defiance. But they’re the bane of joiners!</line>
    <line>A single knot can ruin a plank—or make it priceless, if placed just right. Do you see the poetry in that?</line>
    <line>Knots must be respected. Much like the bark. Ever studied oak bark in detail?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bark">
    <line>Oak bark holds tannins—a powerful alchemical ingredient. But mostly, I admire its texture.</line>
    <line>Rough, ridged, and ancient—oak bark is the armor of giants. Beneath it? Life eternal.</line>
    <line>To some, bark is nuisance. To me, it’s the first draft of the tree’s autobiography.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tannins">
    <line>Tannins preserve, protect, purify. Used in leatherworking, ink-making… even winemaking.</line>
    <line>Oak tannins have touched the finest wines and the toughest leathers. Such hidden power!</line>
    <line>A little tannin goes a long way. Like knowledge. Speaking of which—perhaps you seek purpose?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="purpose" itemType="CollectionQuestScroll" ctorArgs="OakLog,50,8000">
    <line>A life without oak is a life uncrafted. I have one request, friend—gather oak logs for me, and I shall reward you.</line>

    <line>It is settled. Bring me 50 oak logs. I will turn them into legacy—and reward your devotion.</line>

  <entry keyword="leaf">
    <line>An oak leaf is nature’s emblem of endurance. But brittle in autumn. Do you know its shape varies?</line>
    <line>The oak leaf dances in the wind like no other. Ever compare it to a maple?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="maple">
    <line>Maple? A sweet tree, yes. But soft! Give me oak any day. Though maple syrup is a delight.</line>
    <line>Maple syrup’s nice on pancakes—but you can’t build a castle from it. Oak endures.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="syrup">
    <line>Syrup from a tree… it’s magic, truly. But try pouring syrup on a fire—you’ll learn regret.</line>
    <line>Some trees give sweetness, others strength. Rare is the one that gives both.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Fire reveals the soul of wood. Oak burns slow and hot. It’s the fire’s favorite meal.</line>
    <line>A fire built from oak is a fire worth gathering around. Unless you like pine-smoke in your eyes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smoke">
    <line>Oak smoke carries a scent of ancient forests. Hunters say it masks the human smell.</line>
    <line>I once smoked fish with oak bark. The flavor—indescribable! But I digress...</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fish">
    <line>Fish wrapped in oak leaves, grilled over coals… That’s a forgotten art.</line>
    <line>The druids say fish and oak are kindred spirits. I’ve yet to see them climb trees, though.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sapling">
    <line>Every mighty oak was once a humble sapling, trembling in the wind. A reminder to nurture potential.</line>
    <line>Saplings are stubborn survivors. Step lightly—you may be walking on tomorrow’s cathedral beam.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="acorn">
    <line>The acorn—small, unassuming, yet within it slumbers a forest. Isn’t that poetic?</line>
    <line>Acorns are ideas waiting to grow. I keep a few in my pocket—just in case inspiration strikes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="forest">
    <line>The forest is more than trees—it’s memory, motion, and mystery woven together.</line>
    <line>Step into an oak forest and feel the silence watching. Some say the trees whisper if you listen.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shade">
    <line>Oak shade is different. Cooler. Calmer. As if the tree wants you to rest… but only for a moment.</line>
    <line>Beneath an oak’s shade, one can dream without fear. Unless you're allergic to leaves, of course.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="axe">
    <line>Axes are merely translators—helping the forest speak in beams and boards.</line>
    <line>Wield an axe with respect, not haste. Oak won’t yield to the careless.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="carpenter">
    <line>A carpenter is part sculptor, part surgeon. With oak, one must be both patient and bold.</line>
    <line>Carpenters who know oak speak little. They let the wood do the talking.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lute">
    <line>A lute made of oak sings with a deep, mellow voice. Ideal for melancholy minstrels.</line>
    <line>I once strung a lute from storm-felled oak. Its music still haunts me on cold nights.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="thunder">
    <line>They say lightning avoids oak—but the wise know better. Thunder likes to echo in hollow trunks.</line>
    <line>A thunder-struck oak is sacred. Charred, yes—but brimming with primal power.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moss">
    <line>Moss on an oak trunk is like a beard on a scholar—dignified, and full of secrets.</line>
    <line>Some say moss always grows on the north side. I say moss goes where it pleases.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="burrow">
    <line>In old oak roots you’ll find burrows—foxes, badgers, spirits... It’s hard to tell in the dark.</line>
    <line>One never knows what dwells in a root burrow. I once dropped a biscuit in one. Never got it back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>The wind through oak leaves is deeper, fuller. Like a choir humming from far away.</line>
    <line>If you listen to the wind in the trees long enough, you’ll forget what walls sound like.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="splinters">
    <line>Oak splinters are stubborn and sharp—like truth. Painful, but enlightening.</line>
    <line>The mark of a true woodworker? Tiny oak splinters in every fingertip.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="stain">
    <line>A good stain reveals, not conceals. Oak prefers warm hues—deep amber, or perhaps a dusky chestnut.</line>
    <line>To stain oak poorly is to insult a monarch with muddy boots.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bench">
    <line>A well-made oak bench invites contemplation. Or a nap. Or both.</line>
    <line>Benches hold more stories than chairs. Oak benches, especially—they’ve been listening longer.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sawdust">
    <line>The scent of oak sawdust... ah! That’s the perfume of progress.</line>
    <line>Oak sawdust clings to the soul like memory. Sweep it, and it returns twice as thick.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="resin">
    <line>Oak doesn’t bleed sap like pine. Its secrets are buried deeper—like resin turned to amber.</line>
    <line>In rare oaks, resin hardens like glass. I once carved a pendant from such a drop.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="night">
    <line>Oaks look different at night—taller, older, watchful. Some say they move, ever so slightly.</line>
    <line>At night, even a stump can seem like a sentinel. Especially oak.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>The moonlight on oak bark turns silver. That’s how you know a tree has stories worth hearing.</line>
    <line>They say moonlight and oakwood amplify certain rituals. Not that I dabble, of course...</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="beetle">
    <line>Bark beetles loathe oak. Even pests respect a fortress.</line>
    <line>I once watched a beetle flee an oak plank. Said it was too rich for its taste.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="druids">
    <line>Druids worshipped oak trees, you know. Some say their souls still linger in ancient groves.</line>
    <line>The druids taught that oak connected heaven and earth. I just use it to make tables.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tables">
    <line>A table made of oak will outlast its maker. Unlike those flimsy pine things.</line>
    <line>Oak tables are heirlooms, not furniture. Mine creaks like it remembers the forest.</line>

  <entry keyword="phylactery">
    <line>Their soul anchors. Shatter it, and the lich dies. Fail, and it returns—smiling.</line>
    <line>No two phylacteries are alike. Gems, bones, books, even a lover’s heart.</line>

    <line>They don’t steal souls. They *archive* them. Locked away in misery, screaming forever.</line>
    <line>My mentor’s soul is gone—devoured by an Ancient Lich. His body still smiles.</line>

  <entry keyword="magic">
    <line>Liches do not cast spells. They *rewrite* the world. Reality bends out of politeness.</line>
    <line>Their magic is cold, clinical. Every gesture has centuries of precision.</line>
    <line>You’ll feel it before you see it—a pressure in your skull. Like your thoughts are no longer yours.</line>

  <entry keyword="mentor">
    <line>He taught me death was a doorway. The lich showed me what waits beyond.</line>

    <line>Hatred is easy. I reserve mine for the thing that smiles with my mentor’s face.</line>

  <entry keyword="cold">
    <line>It’s not just physical. Lich cold seeps into your memories—freezing joy, cracking purpose.</line>
    <line>The cold they bring isn’t winter. It’s the absence of life remembering how to grieve.</line>

  <entry keyword="smile">
    <line>They always smile. As if amused we still fear death.</line>
    <line>The smile never reaches the eyes. That’s where the hunger lives.</line>

  <entry keyword="eyes">
    <line>Their eyes burn with memory—yours, mine, the world’s. They watch everything end.</line>
    <line>Don’t look into their eyes. You’ll see a future where you’re already dead.</line>

    <line>One tome I found bled ink. It wept for the one who read it last.</line>

    <line>Each bone in a lich is etched with spells—like veins of magic. Break one, suffer two.</line>
    <line>Their skeletons are libraries. Read at your peril.</line>

    <line>A lich’s voice is silk spun through centuries. It calms… then commands.</line>
    <line>You’ll hear it in dreams. Then wake up speaking words you never learned.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="death">
    <line>To them, death is not an ending—it’s a throne.</line>
    <line>They died once. But they remember *how*. That’s what makes them dangerous.</line>

    <line>If you find a tower no one remembers building, a lich may live there.</line>

  <entry keyword="dust">
    <line>Liches don’t leave dust—they command it. I once saw one sculpt a message in ash.</line>
    <line>Where liches dwell, dust gathers in patterns. Spirals, words, warnings.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>A lich casts no reflection. Not due to magic—it simply refuses to be seen.</line>
    <line>I looked in a mirror after speaking with one. My eyes were not my own.</line>

    <line>They carry hourglasses, not for time—but to mock it.</line>
    <line>One shattered near me. The sand whispered my birth date. And my death.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="veil">
    <line>Some say they wear veils to hide the rot. Others say it's shame. I say it's choice.</line>
    <line>A veil is more polite than a skull. But no less terrifying when it speaks.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silence">
    <line>The silence around a lich isn’t absence—it’s reverence. Even sound fears them.</line>
    <line>I once screamed near one. The sound froze. It fell to the ground like broken glass.</line>

  <entry keyword="candle">
    <line>Their candles burn upside-down. Flames whisper backwards.</line>
    <line>I lit one of their candles once. My shadow thanked me—then walked away.</line>

  <entry keyword="library">
    <line>Every lich keeps a library. Some of the books are bound in flesh. Some are still breathing.</line>
    <line>Their libraries don’t need shelves. The books float. They read *themselves*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="key">
    <line>They never lock doors. But you’ll find keys—everywhere. None of them fit anything you know.</line>
    <line>Found a key in an old lich’s robe. It opened a box that wasn’t there until I believed in it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cloak">
    <line>Their cloaks don’t touch the ground. Out of respect, perhaps.</line>
    <line>I watched a lich's cloak move before it did. Like it had intentions of its own.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>They speak in whispers loud enough to echo. It’s not volume. It’s presence.</line>
    <line>If you hear whispering in an empty room, leave. You’re being considered.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>No wind stirs when they pass. The air holds its breath.</line>
    <line>Wind won’t touch them. I asked it once—it said, 'Not again.'</line>

  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>I have a scar from a lich’s gaze. Not touch—gaze. It remembers pain I don’t.</line>
    <line>Scars from their spells fade physically. Mentally? Never.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>They love the moon. Not for light—but for memory. They say it saw the first death.</line>
    <line>Liches meet under full moons. Not to plot. To reminisce.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>Lich towers echo backwards. You hear what you’re going to say.</line>
    <line>I heard my own death echo before I spoke. Still did it anyway.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flesh">
    <line>Their flesh is selective. Some let it rot. Others preserve it with obsession.</line>
    <line>They shape their remains like an artist does clay. Vanity, even in decay.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="finger">
    <line>A lich’s finger held too long can write a curse in your bones.</line>
    <line>I once shook one’s hand. Still can’t unclench mine.</line>

    <line>Their paper is skin-thin. Often literally.</line>
    <line>I read a note once. The ink bled. So did I.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>They do not sleep. But they dream—of what once was theirs.</line>
    <line>Dreams flee from their presence. If you dream of a lich, something followed you back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ring">
    <line>Some wear rings as trophies. Others as chains. None remove them.</line>
    <line>I tried on a lich’s ring. For three days, I couldn’t feel time.</line>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>Liches remember music. Sometimes they hum, centuries out of tune.</line>
    <line>Their bones rattle in chords. I once caught a melody in a scream.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="name">

    <line>Never speak a lich’s name. Not unless it’s already forgotten you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="curse">
    <line>They curse as easily as you breathe. But their curses *linger*.</line>
    <line>I once carried a lich-curse for seven years. It only hurt on days ending in 'y'.</line>

    <line>Citrus fruits—the choir of flavor! But lime sings sharpest, for it holds unmatched acidity.</line>
    <line>Among citrus, lime is the soprano, cutting and bright. It's all about the acidity.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="acidity">
    <line>Acidity: the blade of taste. Yet every sharpness seeks balance.</line>
    <line>Lime’s power lies in acidity, yes—but true magic lies in balance.</line>

    <line>Infusion transforms the humble into the holy. But to truly master lime, you must understand distillation.</line>

    <line>They say fairies dance among nightshade blossoms at twilight. I have yet to see it, but I keep looking.</line>

  <entry keyword="cure">
    <line>Sometimes the cure is as risky as the curse. Nightshade walks the line between both.</line>
    <line>For every poison, there is a cure. Nightshade, ironically, is sometimes both.</line>

  <entry keyword="nightsight">
    <line>You see clearly! I am devoted to the study of Night Sight potions—the world changes after dusk.</line>
    <line>Night Sight, the potion of perception! Most overlook its wonders, but not I. Would you like to discuss vision?</line>
    <line>Ah, Night Sight potions! In the darkness, truth is revealed. Care to talk about vision, the unseen art?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vision">
    <line>Vision beyond vision—that is the gift of Night Sight! The potion reveals what hides in the shadows. Have you ever considered the mysteries of darkness?</line>
    <line>Vision guides the wary. Yet true insight comes when darkness falls. Shall we ponder darkness together?</line>
    <line>To see clearly is to understand—but only those who study darkness know its secrets.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="darkness">
    <line>Darkness is both a veil and a teacher. Only with Night Sight can we pierce it. But have you studied the herbs that birth such magic?</line>
    <line>Many fear the darkness, but I seek its lessons. The secret lies in the right herbs.</line>
    <line>Darkness conceals, but a careful blend of herbs unlocks its mysteries. Would you discuss these rare ingredients?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="herbs">
    <line>Ah, the sacred herbs! Only the keen know of nightshade and mandrake—crucial to Night Sight. Which intrigues you more: nightshade or mandrake?</line>
    <line>The right herbs—nightshade and mandrake—are the backbone of all potent Night Sight brews. Have you handled nightshade before?</line>
    <line>Herbs are subtle, their magic deep. Nightshade or mandrake—each has a tale.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nightshade">
    <line>Nightshade—deadly yet illuminating! Properly prepared, it unlocks a vision of the night. Yet mandrake root adds the spark. Shall I tell you of mandrake?</line>
    <line>Nightshade’s power is double-edged: poison and clarity. But mandrake completes the potion.</line>
    <line>Nightshade must be respected, never feared. The true art lies in its union with mandrake root.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mandrake">
    <line>Mandrake root is rare, its magic profound. Only in harmony with nightshade can it produce Night Sight. The potion itself is a marvel!</line>
    <line>Mandrake root, prized by all alchemists, is key to the potion’s power. Have you brewed Night Sight before?</line>
    <line>Mandrake sings to the moon. With nightshade, it creates a potion unlike any other—Night Sight itself.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="potion">
    <line>The Night Sight potion: luminous, subtle, essential for those who dare the dark! Few appreciate its craft. Would you undertake a special task for a true aficionado?</line>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>The moon—goddess of the night! Its glow inspires all manner of potions, not just Night Sight. Have you tried brewing Invisibility?</line>
    <line>Under a full moon, even shadows seem alive. But Invisibility potions are more fickle, I find.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="invisibility">
    <line>Invisibility—now there’s a tricky brew! Easier to drink than to master, or so they say.</line>
    <line>Some alchemists chase invisibility, but I value seeing, not hiding.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="owl">
    <line>Owls, masters of nocturnal sight! If only I could distill their wisdom into a vial.</line>
    <line>Some say the owl’s gaze sees all. I rely on potions instead!</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="crystal">
    <line>Crystal vials keep potions pure, but beware shattering them at midnight—old superstition.</line>
    <line>A crystal vial refracts light, but a true Night Sight potion works in darkness.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>The stars: distant, cold, yet full of light. Once, I tried making a ‘Starlight’ potion—no luck yet.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cat">
    <line>Cats—nature’s night stalkers! If only I could see as they do. Maybe someday I’ll discover the secret.</line>
    <line>A cat’s eyes gleam in the dark. Perhaps there’s a feline secret to Night Sight brewing?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>Sleep is a cousin to darkness, but dreams rarely reveal the secrets of potions.</line>
    <line>A good night’s sleep is essential for clear vision, both literal and alchemical.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Shadows are just the world hiding from the sun. Sometimes I wonder what secrets they keep.</line>
    <line>Many fear shadows, but I see them as teachers. Have you ever watched your own shadow at midnight?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dusk">
    <line>Dusk is when colors blur and magic awakens. Potions brewed at dusk are said to hold special power.</line>
    <line>There’s a hush at dusk that I find inspiring—a perfect time for brewing or dreaming.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="torch">
    <line>A torch drives away the night, but it can never show you what a Night Sight potion reveals.</line>
    <line>Carrying a torch is wise, unless you’ve learned to trust your other senses in the dark.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bat">
    <line>Bats soar through darkness without fear. Imagine seeing as they do, by sound alone!</line>
    <line>I once tried to befriend a bat for research. It only wanted my fruit, not my potions.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lantern">
    <line>Lanterns are handy, but bulky. I prefer something a little more… drinkable.</line>
    <line>A lantern’s glow is warm, but it won’t help you spot magical traps like Night Sight can.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glass">
    <line>Some believe peering through colored glass reveals secrets. I say, try a potion instead.</line>
    <line>Blown glass vials are beautiful but fragile—much like the balance of night and day.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="herbalist">
    <line>Herbalists have a secret society—so they say. I’ve never been invited, but I have my own recipes.</line>
    <line>A good herbalist knows every scent, but only a few know the art of Night Sight brewing.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="alchemist">
    <line>Alchemists love turning lead to gold, but I prefer turning fear to vision.</line>
    <line>Every alchemist’s lab smells of strange dreams and old parchment. Mine is full of night air.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fog">
    <line>Fog is the night’s disguise—thick and mysterious. No potion I’ve tried can part it completely.</line>
    <line>Some claim to see ghosts in the fog. I just see trouble for travelers.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="thief">
    <line>Thieves prefer the dark, or so they say. I hope they don’t target my potion stores.</line>
    <line>If a thief could brew Night Sight, they’d never stumble over a misplaced shoe.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="owl feather">
    <line>Owl feathers are prized for some potions, but never for Night Sight. Too much superstition!</line>
    <line>I keep an owl feather on my shelf for luck, but I doubt it adds anything to my mixtures.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nightmare">
    <line>Nightmares lurk in sleep, not in the night. Unless you’ve brewed a potion wrong, that is.</line>
    <line>If you drink the wrong thing before bed, don’t blame me for your dreams.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="book">
    <line>I have shelves of books about darkness and sight, but experience is the best teacher.</line>
    <line>Some say there’s a lost tome on the ultimate night potion. If you find it, let me borrow it?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="secret">
    <line>Everyone loves a good secret—especially if it glows in the dark.</line>
    <line>The only secret I’ll share is this: never trust a potion that smells of onions.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="owl eyes">
    <line>People ask me for owl-eye vision. I tell them: get a good potion or learn to squint.</line>
    <line>If I had owl eyes, I’d never spill a vial in the dark. Until then, I’ll keep brewing.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror image">
    <line>Mirrors can trick the mind. In the dark, they reveal even less.</line>
    <line>Some fear their own reflection at night. Me? I fear running out of ingredients.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="serpent">
    <line>Serpents glide through darkness. Maybe one day I’ll craft a potion for slithering, not seeing.</line>
    <line>A serpent’s gaze can freeze you, but it can’t see in the dark like we can with a good brew.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="candle">
    <line>A candle’s flame dances in the night. Easy to snuff out—unlike my curiosity.</line>
    <line>I like to brew by candlelight. It keeps the shadows long and my focus sharp.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="potion belt">
    <line>A well-stocked potion belt is a mark of wisdom. Or paranoia. I have two.</line>
    <line>Don’t let your potions clink together in the night; that’s how you lose friends.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mushroom">
    <line>Not all mushrooms are for eating! Some help with potions, others help with nightmares.</line>
    <line>A glowing mushroom can light your path, but a Night Sight potion lights your mind.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="thistle">
    <line>Thistles are prickly, but they make fine wards against bad dreams.</line>
    <line>Stepping on a thistle in the dark teaches you to appreciate Night Sight quickly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Mirrors reflect the world, but can’t show you what hides in darkness. For that, you need a Night Sight potion.</line>
    <line>Gaze into a mirror by candlelight and you’ll see yourself—try it in the dark with Night Sight for a new experience.</line>

  <entry keyword="cat">
    <line>A ninja moves like a cat, but with more malice and less fur.</line>

    <line>I was once a scholar of oozes. Slimes, jellies, all things viscous and misunderstood.</line>
    <line>I studied their movement, their structure, their strange hunger. Now I study how best to burn them.</line>
    <line>My job? Eradication. I made it my work after they dissolved my life's work... and my apprentice.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="slime">
    <line>Beautiful horrors, aren’t they? A stomach without a face. No eyes, yet they find you.</line>
    <line>Slimes are liquid malice. They corrode what they touch—and they touch everything.</line>
    <line>They slide under doors, through cracks, into dreams. I once adored them. Now I can't sleep because of them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="corrosive">
    <line>Corrosive Slimes are worse than the rest. They don't just consume, they erase.</line>
    <line>Steel, stone, flesh—they dissolve it all. I watched one melt through a vault door like hot wax.</line>
    <line>They're not mindless. They *choose* what to eat. And they remember paths to their prey.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="acid">
    <line>Their acid is alchemical perfection—and pure destruction. Nothing survives it intact.</line>
    <line>I bottled some once. It hissed through glass. Now I keep it in nightmares instead.</line>
    <line>The acid they produce doesn’t just burn. It lingers. Days later, my boots still sizzle.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lab">
    <line>They found my lab. My life’s work, gone in a bubbling puddle of malice.</line>
    <line>I kept them contained. Until one learned to mimic the shape of my keys.</line>
    <line>When the screams stopped, all that remained was smoke, acid scars, and silence.</line>

  <entry keyword="vengeance">
    <line>Knowledge failed. Fire didn't. Now I hunt. And I burn.</line>

  <!-- RED HERRINGS AND FLAVOR DIALOGUE -->

  <entry keyword="ooze">
    <line>Oozes are slimes’ sluggish cousins. Less acid, more appetite.</line>
    <line>I kept an ooze in a jar once. It escaped. Now I keep regrets instead.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="acid burn">
    <line>You can still see the marks. My arm—eight years healed, still screams in the rain.</line>
    <line>Acid eats not just flesh, but memory. That’s what they took from me most.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boots">
    <line>Always wear steel-soled boots. And pray they don’t leak.</line>
    <line>My last pair melted mid-run. The screams came next.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glass">
    <line>Slimes laugh at glass. Well, if they could laugh. Or have mouths. Or joy.</line>
    <line>Nothing contains them for long. Glass, stone, flesh—it’s all the same to acid.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clean">
    <line>They leave nothing behind. No bones. No blood. Just a stink you’ll never forget.</line>
    <line>‘Clean’ is not peace. Not when it comes from something that digests the world.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="splatter">
    <line>Don’t slash a slime unless you want a faceful of regret. Blunt weapons only.</line>
    <line>I watched a warrior split one with a sword. The scream after that? Not from the slime.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smell">
    <line>Rot and vinegar. That’s how you know they’re close.</line>
    <line>The scent clings—months later, my cloak still stinks of one encounter.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mucus">
    <line>Mucus? No, worse. It's like tar that's been taught to hate.</line>
    <line>I once tried to extract it for study. Took three days to clean it off. Still stuck to the walls… and one intern.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sound">
    <line>They don't talk. But they make a noise. A kind of wet slither, like regret crawling.</line>
    <line>Close your eyes near one. You'll hear it breathe. I swear they do.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="floor">
    <line>Always check the floor. A slime waits flat, like a puddle with a grudge.</line>
    <line>My mentor slipped on one. Didn't even realize it until his legs were gone.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="alchemy">
    <line>I once believed their acids could unlock alchemical miracles. Turns out, it just unlocks skin from bones.</line>
    <line>Every alchemist chases the perfect dissolvent. Few survive testing it on slimes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="books">
    <line>Burned every tome I had on slimes. Didn’t want them to learn I knew too much.</line>
    <line>There was a book that screamed when a slime touched it. I took that as a sign.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>They come in my dreams. Sometimes I wake up sticky. I tell myself it’s sweat.</line>
    <line>Dreamed once I *was* a slime. Endless hunger. Woke up chewing my own blanket.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shoes">
    <line>You ever watched leather curl like dry leaves? That’s a slime’s greeting.</line>
    <line>I had enchanted boots once. Slime ate the magic first, then the boots, then my hope.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bucket">
    <line>I caught one in a bucket once. It smiled. Didn’t *have* a face, but it smiled.</line>
    <line>Buckets? Useless. Slimes escape. They just… *change shape* and leave mockingly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flesh">
    <line>They don’t just melt it. They *learn* from it. Each victim makes the next one stronger.</line>
    <line>Some say they taste memories in flesh. I say that's too poetic for monsters.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="torches">
    <line>A torch will scare most creatures. A slime? It just flattens and waits.</line>
    <line>I threw a torch once. It hissed, then launched the flame back. Set my beard on fire.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="names">
    <line>I name them. Not officially. Just... the ones that took things. 'Drip', 'Glow', 'Teacher-Eater'.</line>
    <line>Names don’t matter to them. But it helps *me* remember what I’ve lost.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mistake">
    <line>My biggest mistake? Curiosity. That and letting 'Subject 6' near the plumbing.</line>
    <line>I told myself I was in control. That they were just slime. That was the last lie.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="plumbing">
    <line>Slimes in the pipes. Sounds like a joke, right? That joke melted half a town.</line>
    <line>Never trust a quiet drain. Slimes love silence before the sizzle.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Saw one mimic my face in a mirror once. Took a week before I looked again.</line>
    <line>They don’t have eyes, yet somehow... they reflect you. Wrongly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smoke">
    <line>Burn a slime, and you get smoke that smells like despair and vinegar.</line>
    <line>The smoke from one filled my lungs. Took three days to stop coughing colors.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trails">
    <line>Follow a slime trail, and you'll find two things: a corpse and a question.</line>
    <line>They leave trails behind—slick, slow... sentient. One almost led me back to *my own house*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hatred">
    <line>It’s not fear anymore. It’s hatred. Cold, acidic, permanent.</line>
    <line>You don’t hate them yet. That means you haven’t lost enough.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hat">
    <line>Had a good hat once. Thick leather. A slime wore it away mid-sprint.</line>
    <line>If your hat's melting, it's already too late to run.</line>

    <line>They grow mold like pets. Even the mold tries to eat you.</line>
    <line>Studied their mold once. It blinked. Never went back.</line>

    <line>I heard one hum once. Like a child gurgling underwater. Still not sure if I imagined it.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="regret">
    <line>I regret nothing. Except every minute I thought I could tame them.</line>
    <line>Regret’s the one thing slimes can’t digest. Lucky me—I’ve got a feast’s worth.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="color">
    <line>Corrosive ones shine green—bright, wicked green. If you see it move, don’t blink.</line>
    <line>Color isn’t warning—it’s confidence. They *want* you to see them before they eat you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mute">
    <line>They don’t speak. But they *listen*. Somehow, I know they do.</line>
    <line>Ever felt watched by something that has no eyes? You will, when you fight one.</line>

  <entry keyword="memories">
    <line>I think they remember. The way they follow me… it’s not random. It’s personal.</line>

    <line>Ogres are brutish, yes. But the Arctic Lords—they *plan*. They *remember*.</line>
    <line>You say 'ogre' like it's a joke. Say it again when one's cracked your ribs with a stare.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="arctic">
    <line>The cold preserves their rage. Slows their blood, but not their cruelty.</line>
    <line>Arctic winds shape their minds—silent, brutal, relentless.</line>
    <line>Why are they found only in frozen places? Because fire fears them. As should you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scholar">
    <line>Yes, I studied them. But not for fame. For survival.</line>
    <line>Scholar, survivor, widow... pick a title. They all mean the same thing when you face one alone.</line>
    <line>Books didn’t prepare me. Blood did. But I write now, so others *might* be ready.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>They move in spirals. Not paths. Like they’re herding *something*—or someone.</line>
    <line>They hunt in near silence. Only the crunch of snow warns you... and by then, it’s too late.</line>
    <line>They never eat warm food. Only flesh frozen solid. Ritual? Or preference? I stopped asking.</line>

  <entry keyword="hatred">
    <line>They took my expedition. Seventeen souls, gone in one night. Only I returned. I think...</line>
    <line>Hatred is a poor teacher. But it’s the only one I had after they tore through our camp.</line>

    <line>We set camp on the ridge. The snow was quiet. Too quiet.</line>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>One looked at me. Just one. My bones remembered it for weeks.</line>
    <line>Their eyes aren’t blue. They’re *ice*. And they blink less than death itself.</line>

  <entry keyword="mind">
    <line>They *plan*. Don’t let the brutishness fool you. They set traps.</line>

  <entry keyword="voice">
    <line>They have no language. But they speak in growls, posture, breath. It’s... orchestrated.</line>
    <line>One growled once. Low and slow. My heart didn’t beat again for three seconds.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>They leave bones in patterns. Circles. Stars. I’ve drawn them. Burned them, too.</line>
    <line>Something *guides* them. I don’t think they worship—but they remember rituals.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="map">
    <line>I mapped their movement once. It formed a spiral. Not a coincidence.</line>
    <line>Their paths trace a shape no sane mind would choose. But they repeat it, always.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bones">
    <line>They stack bones neatly. Like they want to tell a story. A terrible one.</line>
    <line>A pile of bones isn’t just remains—it’s a warning. Or a plan.</line>

    <line>You can’t trust the wind out there. It carries lies... and footsteps.</line>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Fire doesn't scare them. It insults them. That’s worse.</line>
    <line>I once lit a ring of torches around our camp. It didn’t stop them—it just made it easier to see the carnage.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="teeth">
    <line>Their teeth aren’t sharp. They’re flat. Crushing. Like glaciers in a jaw.</line>
    <line>I pulled a tooth from one once. Still cold three days later. Still humming, somehow.</line>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>I dream of snow that screams. Of eyes in the dark. Of frost that bites back.</line>
    <line>They visit me in dreams. But I don’t think I’m asleep when they do.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>Sometimes the wind whispers in their voice. Deep. Distant. I don’t listen anymore.</line>
    <line>After the attack, I heard whispers in the cave for weeks. There was no one left to whisper.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="skin">
    <line>Their skin is like frostbitten leather—pale, thick, and dead to pain.</line>
    <line>Touch one and you’ll feel it. Not just cold. *Wrong*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="path">
    <line>They never walk a straight line. They *circle*. Like they’re drawing something only they understand.</line>

  <entry keyword="hill">
    <line>They like hills. Higher ground. Better view. More wind to carry the scent of fear.</line>
    <line>Never trust a quiet hill in ogre country. Silence there is *earned*.</line>

  <entry keyword="torch">
    <line>Torches fail near them. The flames shrink. I carry flint, not hope.</line>
    <line>A torch won’t save you. But it’ll show you what’s coming. Sometimes that’s worse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rune">
    <line>They mark the snow with runes that melt slower. As if the land itself respects them.</line>
    <line>I tried copying their runes. My ink froze mid-stroke. I took the hint.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grudge">
    <line>I killed one of theirs. Three came for me. Weeks later. Miles away.</line>
    <line>They don’t forget. Their hate freezes, but never thaws.</line>

  <entry keyword="ice">
    <line>Ice remembers footsteps. So do I.</line>
    <line>In their hands, ice becomes a weapon. Shaped, honed, flung. I’ve seen it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cave">
    <line>They nest in caves, but they don’t sleep. They *watch*.</line>
    <line>Found a cave once with bones and ice-carved walls. Stayed long enough to regret it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hunt">
    <line>They don’t hunt for hunger. They hunt for presence—for *dominance*.</line>
    <line>Their hunts aren’t chaotic. They're practiced. Efficient. Terrifying.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>Their blood steams in the snow. But it takes a *lot* to spill it.</line>
    <line>It smells sweet. Wrong, but sweet. Like rot dressed in honey.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="snowfall">
    <line>The heaviest snow always comes before they arrive. Nature trying to warn us, maybe.</line>
    <line>A silent snowfall is peaceful... until the tracks show up. Then it's too late.</line>

  <entry keyword="mark">
    <line>They leave marks on trees. Not random. Coordinates, maybe? Or warnings.</line>

    <line>I bred them for strength and stamina. Got both. Too much, in the end.</line>
    <line>Selective breeding is a gamble. Sometimes you raise champions. Sometimes you raise nightmares.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="loss">
    <line>They trampled everything. My pens, my stock, my kin. My boy died feeding one, thinking it still knew him.</line>

  <entry keyword="night">
    <line>They don’t sleep at night — they *prowl*. Sleep during the day, die at dusk.</line>

  <entry keyword="sand">
    <line>Sand gets in everything. Armor, gear... even the mouths of the dead.</line>
    <line>They *use* the sand. Kick it into your eyes, vanish under it, blend into it.</line>

  <entry keyword="flesh">
    <line>They don’t eat all of you. Just the soft parts. The rest they leave for the sun.</line>
    <line>They test flesh before feasting. Bite, sniff, wait. They like fear-marinated meat.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bone">
    <line>Ostards don’t crunch bone — they crack it clean. Saw one snap a rib like a twig.</line>
    <line>They pile bones near nests. I once counted seventeen skulls. None were animal.</line>

  <entry keyword="nest">
    <line>Nests are layered with feathers, scraps, and bones. Smells like ammonia and death.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clutch">
    <line>They lay eggs in hidden clutches. I found one once. Left it. Felt like murder.</line>
    <line>A clutch can hatch in a day. Dozens of tiny nightmares with teeth.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scale">
    <line>Under the feathers — scale. Thick, scarred, and cruel to blades.</line>
    <line>Slice one and you’ll feel it bounce. Hit harder. Or burn it.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>Claws like knives. One nick can open your whole leg.</line>

  <entry keyword="white peach">
    <line>White peaches—mystical and rare. Their scent is an alchemist’s dream. And have you considered what lies within… the pit?</line>
    <line>White peaches are the moon to the sunlit yellow. But the pit! Therein lies the mystery of their essence.</line>
    <line>The flesh delights, but the pit tells the story. Shall we speak of it?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pit">
    <line>The pit—hard, gnarled, and yet fertile. From it, orchards rise. But ah, the blossom… the promise before the fruit!</line>
    <line>The peach pit is a secret keeper. Yet none of it matters without the blossom first, don’t you think?</line>
    <line>From pit to tree, and tree to blossom. Would you like to hear of the peach blossom?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blossom">
    <line>Peach blossoms: fragile as hope, bright as dawn. They carry more magic than they let on. Some say bees whisper secrets into them.</line>
    <line>The blossoms precede the fruit, like dreams before deeds. Have you ever noticed their fragrance attracts bees?</line>
    <line>Peach blossoms bloom just days before the bees arrive. Nature's timing is a kind of enchantment. Let’s speak of those bees.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bees">
    <line>Bees! Those buzzing poets of the orchard. Without them, there are no peaches, only silence. But do you know of their enemy—the worm?</line>
    <line>Bees are sacred to peaches, you see. But peaches have foes as well. The worm is ever hungry.</line>
    <line>The dance of bees makes life, yet the worm consumes it. Would you hear of the worm’s role?</line>

  <entry keyword="worm">
    <line>Worms—blighters of the bough. They hollow out what once was whole. And that, dear friend, is why I need the freshest of fruit.</line>
    <line>The worm creeps where bees dare not buzz. I seek peaches untouched, unspoiled—do you sense my urgency?</line>

  <entry keyword="mint">
    <line>Mint and peach—a dance of crisp and sweet. But if you like mint, you may enjoy lemon balm as well.</line>
    <line>Mint balances peach like shadow balances flame. Ever tried lemon balm?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lemon balm">
    <line>Lemon balm adds a calming touch. Wonderful in tea. Speaking of tea, have you tried peach leaf infusions?</line>
    <line>Ah, lemon balm. A thoughtful herb. But peach leaf tea is the true hidden gem.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tea">
    <line>Peach tea soothes the soul. Add a splash of honey and it becomes alchemy.</line>
    <line>Tea is how we sip the sun slowly. Honey completes it, wouldn’t you agree?</line>

  <entry keyword="honey">
    <line>Honey—liquid gold. But mix it with peach and you’ll never return to plain sweetness. Though… have you ever preserved a peach in brandy?</line>
    <line>Honey with peach is a syrup of dreams. But brandy—now that’s a whole other tale.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="brandy">
    <line>Peach brandy—nectar for winter nights. But too much, and you’ll dream of peaches for days.</line>

  <entry keyword="orchard">
    <line>The orchard is my temple, where branches reach for heaven and fruit falls like blessings.</line>
    <line>Every orchard has its rhythm—some trees hum, others whisper. Listen long enough, and you’ll hear their fruitful secrets.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="summer">
    <line>Summer is the season of dripping peaches and stained fingers. Glorious, sticky abundance!</line>
    <line>Peaches ripen under summer's gaze. Too hot, they sulk. Too cold, they delay. Timing is everything.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="skin">
    <line>Peach skin—it repels some, attracts others. Fuzzy like a secret kept too long.</line>
    <line>The skin is a mystery: thin enough to bite, thick enough to protect. Much like trust.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>The moon governs tides and the rising of sap. Peaches bloom best under the waxing crescent, I swear it.</line>
    <line>Some say peaches carry moonlight in their blush. Perhaps that’s why dreams taste sweeter after one.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>The wind tells stories to the leaves. In my orchard, I hear it whispering gossip between the boughs.</line>
    <line>A still orchard is unsettling. I prefer a breeze to stir the branches and scatter the perfume of ripeness.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="perfume">
    <line>The scent of a peach is the memory of sun captured in fuzz. There’s no alchemy like aroma.</line>
    <line>I once chased a scent across a hillside, thinking it was a peach. Turned out to be a trickster’s spell.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cobbler">
    <line>Peach cobbler—culinary divinity! But alas, I dare not waste ripe specimens on ovens.</line>
    <line>The only thing better than a peach? A bubbling cobbler with crust like clouds and cinnamon dreams.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pitfall">
    <line>Every fruit has its trap. A rotten one bruises the tongue. A wormy one wounds the soul.</line>
    <line>The danger of perfection is disappointment. Better to expect a pit in every peach, I say.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dreams">
    <line>I once dreamed of a peach that glowed like starlight. I awoke sticky. Coincidence?</line>
    <line>Dreams are like orchards—wild, tangled, and always hiding fruit you didn’t plant.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="alchemist">
    <line>Alchemists seek gold, but I? I seek the ideal peach. Both require patience and a little madness.</line>
    <line>In alchemy, peaches symbolize transformation. Flesh to spirit, juice to essence. Pit to power.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="breeze">
    <line>The breeze carries pollen, stories, and the occasional petal. It is the orchard’s gossip.</line>
    <line>Without the breeze, the peaches would grow vain and bored. Motion keeps them humble.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Too much sun, and the fruit scorches. Fire is friend and foe to the orchard alike.</line>
    <line>I once tried roasting peaches over open flame. Delicious, but they wept as they caramelized.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="owl">
    <line>An owl watches over my trees. She hoots approval when a peach drops ripe.</line>
    <line>The owl is my only witness. She sees the fruit ripen and the worms arrive. A silent judge of sweetness.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="root">
    <line>Never forget the roots. They toil in darkness so the fruit may blush in light.</line>
    <line>A peach’s root seeks water, but also memory. Each year’s fruit remembers the last’s rainfall.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Even the ripest peach casts a shadow. Beware those who shine too brightly.</line>
    <line>The shadow beneath a tree is where truths settle like leaves. Sit there long enough, you’ll learn something.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ferment">
    <line>Left too long, peaches ferment. What was sweet becomes bold… even dangerous.</line>
    <line>Peach wine is no laughing matter. It tastes like youth but acts like age.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bird">
    <line>Birds take the first bite. I don’t mind—it’s their tax for singing.</line>
    <line>A smart bird pecks the softest spot. A wise orchard keeper watches where they gather.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="harvest">
    <line>Harvest time—equal parts joy and sorrow. For every peach taken, a branch breathes lighter.</line>
    <line>The harvest reveals who you are. Do you pick with reverence or greed?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="knife">
    <line>A good peach barely needs a knife—it yields like a secret. But still, I carry one. Just in case.</line>
    <line>My knife is for splitting fruit and opening truths. Funny how similar those two are.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sun">
    <line>Peaches are born of sunlight. Too little and they sulk. Too much and they burn. Life is balance, no?</line>
    <line>The sun kisses peaches awake. But without water, they wither. Just like us.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="water">
    <line>Water—the quiet partner in the peach’s life. Yet too much, and even the strongest root will drown.</line>
    <line>Peaches drink deeply, yet modestly. Like any noble spirit.</line>

  <entry keyword="ripeness">
    <line>Ripeness is an art, not a science. It begins at the neck—press gently, like greeting royalty.</line>
    <line>To test ripeness, press the stem-end. Pears ripen off the tree, you know.</line>
    <line>Only a skilled nose and finger can judge true ripeness. But that leads us to texture, does it not?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="texture">
    <line>The grain of a pear—its texture—is the key to its soul. Smooth, juicy, with a whisper of grit.</line>
    <line>Texture defines the experience: crisp or buttery. Have you explored the joy of Bosc pears?</line>
    <line>Texture is everything. Like poetry in fruit. Especially if you've had a Bosc recently...</line>

  <entry keyword="bosc">
    <line>Bosc pears, rough-skinned but bold. A baker’s dream. Yet I still pine for the elusive Comice.</line>
    <line>Bosc is sturdy, reliable. But if you’ve had Comice, you know true bliss.</line>
    <line>Bosc are noble—but wait until you’ve had a Comice. Do you know of them?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="comice">
    <line>Comice: the queen of pears! Sweet, soft, a kiss of the orchard. But hard to grow without proper grafting.</line>
    <line>Comice pears are luscious but delicate. Their cultivation is an art—requiring masterful grafting.</line>
    <line>Comice is divine. Yet behind it is science: grafting. A lost skill to many these days.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grafting">
    <line>Ah, grafting! The old tree-witchery. Pear trees need partners to thrive—like quince, for example.</line>
    <line>Grafting is the art of binding lives. Pears often grow best on quince rootstock.</line>
    <line>To graft is to shape fate. Many pears are grafted onto quince. Have you heard of it?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="quince">
    <line>Quince! Hard and bitter alone, but the perfect root for a pear's rise.</line>
    <line>Quince roots give pears strength, though few honor the sacrifice.</line>
    <line>Quince bears no sweetness, but allows pears to shine. From bitterness, sweetness grows.</line>

    <line>Juice is fine, but it lacks the nuance of biting into the real thing. Especially when chilled.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chilled">
    <line>A chilled pear—soothing in summer. But beware: too cold, and the flavor dulls.</line>
    <line>Chilling preserves, but also hides. Much like the moon behind clouds. Lovely, but distant.</line>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>The moon governs the tides—and they say, fruit growth. Farmers still whisper of moon-picking.</line>
    <line>Some harvest pears by moonlight, believing it sweetens the flesh. Superstition, or truth?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="harvest">
    <line>Harvest time is sacred. Pears must be picked just before full ripeness, then left to mature.</line>
    <line>Timing is all. A day too late, and the pear is mush. Like opportunity—sweet, then gone.</line>

  <entry keyword="orchard">
    <line>Ah, the orchard—where patience and pruning meet. It’s where I learned to listen to the leaves.</line>
    <line>There’s nothing like walking through a pear orchard at dawn. The scent alone is worth waking early for.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tree">
    <line>Each tree has its own will. Some pears ripen with kindness, others with silence.</line>

  <entry keyword="skin">
    <line>The skin of a pear is its armor—thin, but meaningful. Judge not by blemish alone.</line>
    <line>Some prefer to peel the skin, but I say: let the fruit speak for itself, unmasked.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="stem">
    <line>The stem tells the story of harvest. If it breaks clean, the fruit was ready to part ways.</line>
    <line>Always check the stem. A brittle snap means nature gave permission.</line>

  <entry keyword="season">
    <line>Pear season is brief, but glorious. Like a poem that ends before you’re ready.</line>

  <entry keyword="bark">
    <line>Bark is the journal of a tree’s life. Scrapes, scalds, even laughter—if you know how to read it.</line>

    <line>The pear’s bloom is brief—a flurry of white before the green fruit swells.</line>
    <line>Spring blossoms are like whispered promises. Only some become fruit.</line>

    <line>The soil beneath a pear tree must be well-fed, but never soggy. Like the mind—rich but not overwhelmed.</line>
    <line>Good soil remembers every step, every root. It is the library of the orchard.</line>

  <entry keyword="basket">
    <line>A pear basket must be shallow—stack too deep, and the bruises begin.</line>

  <entry keyword="taste">
    <line>Taste is memory. A good pear will take you somewhere—even if you’ve never been.</line>
    <line>Taste lingers longer than truth, I find. Especially when the juice runs down your wrist.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="juice">
    <line>Pear juice is a gentle thing. Subtle, like a secret told only once.</line>
    <line>They bottle the juice, but not the memory. That’s the difference between food and fruit.</line>

    <line>Smelting! The glorious birth of metal from rock. A smoky ritual, both violent and beautiful. But what do you know of slag?</line>
    <line>Where there is smelting, there is slag. Waste to some—wisdom to others.</line>
    <line>Smelting brings forth purity... and slag. A byproduct, yes, but not without secrets.</line>

  <entry keyword="slag">
    <line>Slag tells stories, if you know how to listen. But for purity—one seeks bloom.</line>
    <line>Even slag sings, in a way. But the bloom—that's the metal’s true awakening.</line>
    <line>Slag is the echo. Bloom is the voice. Do you follow?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bloom">
    <line>A bloom is what’s left when fire takes everything unworthy. But tell me—have you touched hematite?</line>
    <line>Bloom iron is born from chaos. Hematite begins that chaos. Seek it, and you begin to understand.</line>

  <entry keyword="hematite">
    <line>Ah, hematite. Bloody and brilliant. But not all red stones are so honest. Some hide sulfur.</line>

  <entry keyword="sulfur">
    <line>Sulfur is a trickster. It corrupts and purifies all at once. Alchemists dream of such duality.</line>
    <line>Sulfur stings the nose, awakens the spirit. It's vital in transformation—ever hear of black powder?</line>
    <line>Sulfur dances with flame. In the right hands, it becomes black powder. Dangerous? Certainly. Powerful? Undeniably.</line>

  <entry keyword="black powder">
    <line>Black powder—it began with curiosity, ended in craters. But it taught us much about combustion.</line>
    <line>Black powder is Pig Iron's unruly cousin—explosive, but less stable. You want stability? You want alloy.</line>
    <line>All good ironworkers flirt with black powder. But we marry alloy.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="alloy">
    <line>Alloy is compromise perfected. A marriage of metals to birth resilience.</line>
    <line>In alloy, we find the future of Pig Iron. Mixed, but not diluted.</line>

    <line>The raw bird: a culinary wonder and an alchemist's puzzle. Of all, wild fowl are the most prized. Care to hear about them?</line>

  <entry keyword="midnight grouse">
    <line>The midnight grouse is a bird shrouded in shadows, prized by only the boldest chefs. But its true rival is the crimson quail.</line>
    <line>Ah, the midnight grouse—delicate, elusive! Yet the crimson quail brings heat to any banquet.</line>
    <line>The midnight grouse is rare, but for fire and spice, one must seek the crimson quail.</line>

  <entry keyword="crimson quail">
    <line>The crimson quail's feathers are said to ignite when cooked! A delicacy for the daring—though not as potent as the sun-plume chick.</line>
    <line>Crimson quail are a fiery treat, but my research turns now to the sun-plume chick. Interested?</line>
    <line>A crimson quail will set your heart ablaze, but a sun-plume chick can light your soul. Shall I elaborate?</line>

  <entry keyword="sun-plume chick">
    <line>Sun-plume chicks glow faintly with residual magic—just imagine their effect on a well-crafted stew! Of course, everything begins with a good marinade.</line>
    <line>A sun-plume chick is precious, but the secret is always in the marinade. Would you like a recipe?</line>
    <line>The sun-plume chick’s power is unlocked by the perfect marinade. All chefs chase that secret blend!</line>

  <entry keyword="marinade">
    <line>Marinade is the silent partner of every great bird. Yet even a master’s marinade is useless without the right technique: tenderizing.</line>
    <line>A perfect marinade begs for proper tenderizing—too little, and you waste the bird!</line>
    <line>Ah, marinade—so simple, yet so vital. But have you learned the art of tenderizing?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tenderizing">
    <line>Tenderizing transforms a tough bird into a masterpiece. But to truly savor their essence, one must taste them raw. Are you bold enough?</line>
    <line>Tenderizing is an art, but sometimes, the bravest sample their birds untouched—raw and pure.</line>

  <entry keyword="egg">
    <line>Eggs? Delightful, but a different study entirely. Did you know some believe eggs should be pickled for a fortnight?</line>
    <line>Eggs are the start of life, but I find their potential rather... limited. Pickling, though, is a fascinating process.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pickled">
    <line>Pickled eggs are a peasant’s fare—unless spiced with rare herbs. Speaking of herbs, have you a favorite?</line>
    <line>Pickling preserves but doesn’t elevate. True flavor comes from herbs—what's your herb of choice?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="herb">
    <line>Herbs bring aroma to any dish. Sage for wisdom, rosemary for memory—have you tried a blend?</line>
    <line>A pinch of herb can transform a meal. Yet the right blend is a closely guarded secret.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blend">
    <line>Blends are the heart of any master chef’s repertoire. But beware—some blends can put you right to sleep. Have you heard of the dreamleaf?</line>
    <line>A mysterious blend can elevate or ruin. Dreamleaf, for instance, is best avoided unless you seek deep sleep.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dreamleaf">
    <line>Dreamleaf tea can make you slumber for days! I once lost a whole weekend to it. Perhaps you’d rather discuss roasting techniques?</line>
    <line>Dreamleaf is favored by lazy sorcerers. But roasting—that’s the real challenge for any bird lover.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="roasting">
    <line>Roasting brings out bold flavors, but if you’re not careful, you’ll end up with a charred mess. Always mind the fire!</line>
    <line>The right fire makes all the difference. Have you tried oak for roasting? It imparts a lovely smokiness.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Fire is both friend and foe in the kitchen. Too much and all is lost! Water, on the other hand, is often overlooked.</line>
    <line>Fire for heat, water for balance. The art is in knowing when to use which.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feather">
    <line>Feathers? Intriguing! Some say a single feather brings good luck, but I find they simply get everywhere in the kitchen.</line>
    <line>Feathers have many uses—quills, fletching, even magical rituals. But none, sadly, in the flavor department.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="quill">
    <line>A good quill makes for fine writing, but not for fine dining! Unless you’re jotting down recipes, of course.</line>
    <line>Quills scratch secrets onto parchment, but the only secrets I seek are those of taste.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="beak">
    <line>The beak is the bird’s badge of honor—sharp or stout, it reveals much about its habits. Not much use in a stew, though.</line>
    <line>Chefs say the beak is to be avoided, unless you’re making stock for a true gourmand.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="plumage">
    <line>Plumage: dazzling to the eye, but not the palate. However, some believe the color predicts the flavor!</line>
    <line>They say a bird’s plumage hints at its temperament. I wonder if that affects the taste?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="soup">
    <line>Bird soup warms the soul! But true aficionados know it’s the broth, not the bird, that matters.</line>
    <line>A hearty bird soup is a comfort, but I find it lacks the nuance of more refined preparations.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="broth">
    <line>A crystal-clear broth is a badge of honor among chefs, yet I seek bolder flavors. Ever tried infusing a broth with saffron?</line>
    <line>Broth is the silent hero of any stew. The secret is simmering bones, but don’t tell the vegetarians.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="saffron">
    <line>Saffron—rare and expensive! Some say a single thread can turn a dish golden. I say, use it sparingly or not at all.</line>
    <line>A dish with saffron always impresses nobles, but my palate prefers wilder flavors.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spice">
    <line>Spice is the traveler’s gift. Each grain tells a story from distant lands.</line>
    <line>Too much spice and you lose the bird entirely! Balance is everything.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fork">
    <line>Ah, the humble fork! Four tines to rule them all. Some say true masters eat only with their fingers.</line>
    <line>A silver fork adds class to any meal, but a wooden one feels honest. Don’t ask me to choose.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="knife">
    <line>A sharp knife is a chef’s best friend. Never trust a cook who keeps a dull blade.</line>
    <line>Knives come in all shapes, each with a purpose. Did you know there’s a knife just for carving partridge?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pan">
    <line>A well-seasoned pan holds the memory of a thousand meals. Never wash it with soap!</line>
    <line>Pans are precious! I’ve seen duels fought over cast iron. It’s not just cookware, it’s legacy.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="stew">

    <line>Marrow: soft, fatty, and prized by alchemists and chefs alike. Spread it on toasted bread and see the gods smile.</line>

  <entry keyword="sauce">
    <line>The right sauce can redeem any bird. I have a secret recipe, but I’ll never share it!</line>
    <line>Sauce must complement, never overwhelm. Unless you’re hiding a mistake.</line>

  <entry keyword="drumstick">
    <line>A drumstick in hand makes anyone feel like royalty! Watch for sticky fingers.</line>
    <line>Children and kings alike crave drumsticks—nature’s handle, nature’s treat.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nest">
    <line>A nest is home, shelter, and sometimes a meal for the desperate. I prefer my birds fully fledged.</line>
    <line>Nest-building is an art among birds. I suppose cooking is ours.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="migration">
    <line>Birds that migrate grow strong—tougher meat, some say, but richer in flavor.</line>
    <line>Migration fills the sky with hope, and my larder with surprises.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sky">
    <line>The open sky is where birds are free. Me? I’m happiest beneath a kitchen roof.</line>
    <line>I watch birds soar and wonder: do they dream of being cooked just right?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cat">

    <line>Keep your birds close and your cats closer, I always say.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="salt">
    <line>Salt is the foundation of flavor. Without it, even the finest bird is bland.</line>
    <line>In some lands, salt is worth more than gold. I’d trade a sack for a good bird, though.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>A good oven makes all the difference. Mine sings when it’s hot enough—though perhaps that’s just the steam.</line>
    <line>An oven’s warmth is a chef’s embrace. But too much and your bird is charcoal.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="charcoal">
    <line>Charcoal grilling—bold flavors, bold risks. Perfect for wild fowl!</line>
    <line>Nothing beats the aroma of a charcoal fire. Unless you count the taste of a raw bird, of course.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="apron">
    <line>A stained apron is a badge of honor. If yours is clean, you’re not working hard enough.</line>

    <line>Ah, you noticed! I am quite the devotee of raw ribs—truly the backbone of cuisine.</line>
    <line>Ribs, yes! Most folk overlook them, but there’s artistry in their preparation. Are you partial to seasoning?</line>
    <line>Raw ribs are my passion! But it’s not all about the meat—the right seasoning changes everything.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="seasoning">
    <line>Seasoning brings raw ribs to life! Have you experimented with sage? It’s my personal favorite.</line>
    <line>The secret to memorable ribs is always in the seasoning. I swear by sage, though some prefer thyme.</line>
    <line>Sage! That is the true magician in my kitchen. Ever cooked with it?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sage">
    <line>Sage gives ribs a rustic aroma. Yet to balance the flavors, you need a splash of vinegar.</line>
    <line>Sage and vinegar—unbeatable! The aroma alone is enough to make your stomach rumble.</line>
    <line>A sprinkle of sage and a dash of vinegar—that’s the tradition in my family.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vinegar">
    <line>Vinegar! Not too much, mind you. It tenderizes, unlocks flavor, and keeps the ribs juicy.</line>
    <line>Just a splash! Vinegar brings out the best in raw ribs. It’s the secret to tenderness.</line>
    <line>Without vinegar, you miss half the flavor! Did you know the best vinegar comes from apples?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="apples">
    <line>Apple vinegar—now that’s a delicacy! Sometimes I even roast apples alongside the ribs.</line>
    <line>Apples and ribs, a pairing as old as feasts themselves. Adds a touch of sweetness, don’t you agree?</line>
    <line>A bite of apple between mouthfuls of ribs—perfection. But let’s not forget the bones.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bones">
    <line>Some folks toss the bones, but I collect them. There’s wisdom in the marrow. Ever brewed bone broth?</line>

    <line>All meat is nourishing, but ribs are special—they tell a story. Have you ever tasted venison?</line>
    <line>Meat comes in many forms, but none delight me quite like ribs. Venison is popular in the wild, though.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="venison">
    <line>Venison is lean and wild—hunters bring it fresh from the forests. Some prefer it to pork, but not me.</line>
    <line>Venison is a hunter’s prize, but a rib lover’s heart always stays with pork. Speaking of, do you enjoy sausages?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sausage">
    <line>Sausages are fine, but they hide their secrets in casings. Ribs are honest, bare to the bone.</line>
    <line>A good sausage has its place, but ribs are the showstopper at any feast.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feast">
    <line>A feast without ribs is just a meal. Have you ever attended a harvest festival?</line>
    <line>At the harvest festival, they say the ribs disappear first! Good thing I keep a secret stash.</line>

  <entry keyword="festival">
    <line>Festivals are for merriment and, of course, ribs. But let’s not lose focus—the finest ribs are for true collectors.</line>
    <line>Festivals come and go, but a well-cured rib stays with you. Let’s get back to the art of rib appreciation, shall we?</line>

  <entry keyword="cooking">
    <line>Cooking is an endless pursuit of perfection. Even after all these years, ribs teach me something new every day.</line>
    <line>Every rib, every cut—there’s always more to learn. The perfect rib might be out there still.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Ribs over a roaring fire—there’s nothing like it. The crackle, the aroma! But raw ribs have their own magic.</line>
    <line>Fire reveals flavor, but so does patience. Sometimes, the best ribs are enjoyed raw, with the right company.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="salt">
    <line>Salt—essential for any cook, but too much will ruin the ribs. Have you ever tried sea salt?</line>
    <line>Salt draws out the flavor, but the best is harvested from distant shores. Sea salt is my favorite.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sea salt">
    <line>Sea salt has a unique crunch. Pirates once traded barrels of it for the best ribs!</line>
    <line>A pinch of sea salt and ribs are transformed. But beware—seagulls are notorious for stealing both!</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gravy">
    <line>Gravy with ribs? Some say it’s a match made in heaven, others call it heresy.</line>
    <line>A good gravy can hide a poor cut, but great ribs need no disguise. Have you ever debated this at a tavern?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tavern">
    <line>Tavern tales are thick as stew. Last night, a bard tried to pay for his meal in rib bones!</line>
    <line>I’ve sampled ribs in every tavern from here to Vesper. Some were so spicy, even the barkeep wept.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spicy">
    <line>Spicy ribs? A bold choice! I once used peppers so hot, a knight demanded a bucket of milk.</line>
    <line>Heat has its place, but some flavors are best appreciated slowly. Like good company, or a long story.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="story">
    <line>There are more rib stories than stars in the sky. Have you heard the legend of the Rib King?</line>
    <line>Once, a mage tried to conjure the perfect rib—he summoned a dragon instead. The tavern never recovered.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dragon">
    <line>Dragon ribs? That’s just a tale for children! Real ribs come from more modest beasts.</line>
    <line>If you ever find dragon ribs, let me know. I’d be curious to try them, just once.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="kitchen">
    <line>My kitchen is my kingdom. No one enters without my say-so—unless they bring ribs.</line>
    <line>Order in the kitchen! Or at least, that’s what I shout when someone drops the ribs.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cat">
    <line>Cats are always after my ribs! I had to invent a rib-guard just to keep them away.</line>
    <line>A cat once stole my best rib. I never trusted felines after that day.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ale">
    <line>Ale and ribs—a classic pair. Though too much ale, and you might forget the ribs entirely.</line>
    <line>Some say ale tenderizes the ribs if you spill enough of it during the meal.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="onion">
    <line>Onions add depth, but too many and you’ll scare away your dinner guests.</line>
    <line>Raw onions on ribs? Only for the bold, or those with no plans to socialize.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="garlic">
    <line>Garlic keeps vampires away—and possibly, polite company. Still, I wouldn’t serve ribs without it.</line>
    <line>If your ribs aren’t garlicky, are they really ribs? That’s a debate for another day.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pie">
    <line>Pie for dessert is tradition, though I’ve known folks who’d put ribs in the pie!</line>
    <line>Meat pies are a staple around here, but I prefer my ribs on the bone, thank you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dessert">
    <line>Dessert after ribs? Only if you can still move. I recommend something light—perhaps stewed apples.</line>
    <line>The sweet after the savory. Balance is important in all things, even feasts.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nap">
    <line>A good rib feast demands a long nap afterwards. That’s the sign of a meal well enjoyed.</line>
    <line>I once napped so long after ribs, I missed the next day’s breakfast!</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="breakfast">
    <line>Ribs for breakfast? That’s ambition! I usually stick to porridge, but I admire your style.</line>
    <line>Some folks claim a cold rib at sunrise is good luck. I say, why not?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="porridge">
    <line>Porridge is honest fare, but it can’t compare to ribs. Still, it’ll keep you warm on a cold morning.</line>
    <line>Once I tried adding bits of rib to my porridge. My mother never forgave me.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="market">
    <line>The market has the freshest ribs, if you know where to look. Watch out for pickpockets!</line>
    <line>Market day is when you find the choicest cuts, and hear the best gossip.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gossip">
    <line>Gossip travels faster than a roasting fire. Most of it isn’t true—except the bit about my ribs.</line>
    <line>If you listen at the market, you’ll learn who has the best meat and who’s behind on their bar tab.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bar tab">
    <line>My bar tab is as long as a dragon’s tail—worth every coin if the ribs are good.</line>
    <line>They say you can pay off a bar tab with a rack of ribs, but only if the barkeep is hungry.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="company">
    <line>Company makes a meal. Sharing ribs with friends is the greatest joy. But enough of that—back to my collection!</line>

    <line>I once had a student who mistook salt for sugar. The resulting potion was… memorable.</line>

    <line>Gold—unchanging, incorruptible. Yet only when shaped into a ring does it earn my praise. Speak now of gold rings!</line>
    <line>Wealth in its rawest form is meaningless. Only when forged into a ring does gold reveal its soul.</line>

    <line>Gold rings are more than ornament—they resonate. Have you ever tested one’s attunement with a *gem*?</line>
    <line>The gold ring—unassuming, yet potent. Especially when paired with the correct gemstone. Let us muse upon gems, yes?</line>
    <line>Each gold ring hums with silent power. But to unlock its song, one must understand gems.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gem">
    <line>Gems are the eyes of the ring, peering into fate. Yet clarity is everything. Have you studied *clarity*?</line>
    <line>A gem without clarity is a clouded soul. Seek clarity, and you seek perfection.</line>
    <line>Clarity is to gems what melody is to music—without it, beauty fails. Shall we ponder clarity?</line>

    <line>Clarity—the honest heart of the gem. But so few possess it. And rarer still is the skill to *craft* with it.</line>
    <line>To see clearly is a virtue of both jeweler and gem. Crafting, dear friend, is where clarity finds purpose.</line>
    <line>Clarity gives us truth; crafting gives us expression. Let us now speak of the sacred art—craft.</line>

    <line>Craft is both science and sorcery. But crafting rings? That is pure *alchemy* of purpose and passion.</line>

  <entry keyword="alchemy">
    <line>Alchemy—the root of transformation. Like turning lead to gold, or will into *worth*.</line>
    <line>Alchemy is the mother of value. It makes the worthless wondrous. Which brings us, naturally, to worth.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="worth">
    <line>Worth lies not in carats or coin—but in resonance, in the *aura* of the ring.</line>

  <entry keyword="stars">
    <line>Stars are like gems scattered across the heavens. Yet none are as precious as a *ruby*, set in gold.</line>
    <line>I once saw a ring etched with constellations. They say it housed a ruby that burned like a star.</line>

    <line>Metal is only the body; intent is the soul. Bronze, tin, iron—all lack the dignity of gold.</line>

  <entry keyword="tin">
    <line>Tin—useful for soldiers’ toys, not for rings. Unless you're fashioning a mockery. Why not consider *lead*?</line>
    <line>Tin rusts faster than dreams in daylight. Lead might serve you better—though it’s no ring-maker's choice.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lead">
    <line>Lead is the alchemist’s temptation. It wants to be gold, but never will be. It is the dream of failure.</line>

    <line>Ah, jewelcraft! A discipline of detail, but not one for dabblers. Perhaps *engraving* is more your level.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="engraving">
    <line>The chisel is a dangerous poet. Some carve meaning, others mar beauty. Care to speak of *inscriptions*?</line>

    <line>Inscriptions—etched memories, sometimes lies. But rarely power. Have you ever tried to *decode* one?</line>

    <line>Feathers everywhere! The price of working with birds, I suppose. At least they’re good for stuffing pillows.</line>
    <line>If you see a stray feather, you can bet a roast is close at hand—or perhaps a rather angry goose.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="goose">

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>A crackling fire, the scent of roasting meat—that’s home to me. Just mind your eyebrows!</line>
    <line>Fire is a fickle friend. Too hot, and you’ll scorch the feast; too low, and you’ll wait all night.</line>

  <entry keyword="onion">
    <line>A wise cook knows: start with an onion, and you’re halfway to a meal. Tears now, smiles later!</line>

    <line>Ah, the ruby—stone of passion and power. A gem that sings to those who truly listen.</line>
    <line>You admire rubies? Then you are no ordinary traveler. Do you know of their fire?</line>
    <line>Rubies are not mere ornaments—they are living flame encased in stone. Care to hear of their fire?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Ruby’s fire is not heat—but spirit. Much like its cousin, the garnet, though lesser in intensity.</line>
    <line>Fire is what separates rubies from the mundane. Even the garnet tries to imitate their glow.</line>
    <line>Fire is the soul of ruby. But garnets burn with a different kind of flame. Shall we compare?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="garnet">
    <line>Garnets are like apprentices to the ruby's masterwork. But to truly see the difference, one must polish.</line>
    <line>A garnet is bold, but unrefined. Rubies, after polishing, become lenses of perfection.</line>
    <line>Polish a garnet, and you get glass. Polish a ruby, and you hold a legacy.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="polish">
    <line>Polishing is sacred—it reveals the truth of a gem. And few endure the process like corundum.</line>
    <line>Ah yes, polishing—a meditation in motion. It is through this that the ruby's corundum heart is revealed.</line>

  <entry keyword="corundum">
    <line>Corundum: the family of rubies and sapphires. A kingdom of kings and queens of stone.</line>
    <line>Yes, corundum—a mineral of royalty. The ruby its heart, the sapphire its crown.</line>
    <line>Corundum binds sapphire and ruby together—but it is ruby that carries the flame. Have you studied resonance?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="resonance">
    <line>A ruby’s resonance hums in tune with the soul. This is why they are used in delicate enchantments.</line>
    <line>Only skilled artisans can attune to a ruby’s resonance. Such frequency must be respected.</line>
    <line>Resonance is the silent language of gems. The ruby? It shouts. Would you know why?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="enchantment">
    <line>Rubies hold enchantments longer than most stones—some say because of their link to blood and life.</line>
    <line>The most powerful enchanters favor ruby cores—for longevity, intensity, and passion.</line>
    <line>Enchantment binds intent to matter. With ruby, intent becomes destiny.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>Blood and ruby—twins in color, and in myth. Some say rubies grow where warriors fall.</line>
    <line>The legends say rubies are crystallized drops of ancient blood. But legends need proof, don’t they?</line>
    <line>Blood fuels life. Ruby stores it, symbolically. Or perhaps literally, in old tales.</line>

  <entry keyword="legend">
    <line>Legends speak of a Ruby Forge buried beneath volcanic stone. I study such tales in hopes of finding truth—and materials.</line>

    <line>Jewelers are storytellers in gold and stone. Some are honest. Most are expensive.</line>

    <line>Ah... the sapphire. A gem of clarity and power. What draws *you* to its azure depths?</line>
    <line>Sapphire—sky forged into stone. I’ve studied them for decades. Ever heard of corundum?</line>
    <line>You speak the sacred name. Sapphires are more than jewels. Do you know of corundum, its parent?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="corundum">
    <line>Corundum—the mineral heart from which both sapphire and ruby are born.</line>
    <line>It’s true. Both rubies and sapphires come from corundum. But color is only the beginning. Do you know the role of iron?</line>
    <line>Corundum is the canvas; iron the painter. Shall I tell you how iron brings the blue to life?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="iron">
    <line>Iron gifts the sapphire its hue. Without it, the stone is a ghost of itself.</line>
    <line>Trace iron shifts the spectrum—deepening blue, stirring magic. But the stone must also be *clear.* Let’s speak of clarity.</line>
    <line>Iron taints and blesses. But clarity—that is purity. Would you know how clarity speaks to power?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clarity">
    <line>The clearer the gem, the stronger its resonance with arcane frequencies.</line>
    <line>Clarity is focus. The fewer the flaws, the stronger the sapphire's essence. I’ve seen flawed stones hum. But perfect ones *sing.*</line>
    <line>Clarity is more than beauty. It is alignment. Alignment to what, you ask? The celestial sphere.</line>

  <entry keyword="moonlight">
    <line>Yes. Under moonlight, sapphires gleam with a different fire. Some say they whisper. I've heard it.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="snow">
    <line>Snowflakes form with the same sixfold symmetry as sapphire crystals. Coincidence? I doubt it.</line>
    <line>Sapphires don’t melt in snow. They sing, if you listen close enough.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="obsidian">
    <line>Obsidian is volcanic glass—shiny, but chaotic. It lacks sapphire’s inner order.</line>
    <line>If sapphire is the scholar, obsidian is the assassin. Pretty, but jagged in all the wrong places.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="amber">
    <line>Amber is fossilized sunlight. A lovely bauble. But it can’t withstand pressure like a sapphire.</line>
    <line>Some say amber holds memories. I say: it’s a trap for insects, not insight.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="quartz">
    <line>Quartz is the bread of gems—common, unremarkable. Sapphires are the rare wine.</line>
    <line>A fool tried to sell me quartz once. Said it was sky-captured. I told him to try again—under water.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lenscraft">
    <line>Sapphire lenses reveal things ordinary glass cannot—fault lines in magic, fissures in time.</line>
    <line>Lenscraft is delicate work. Too much pressure, and your sapphire becomes powder. Useful, but tragic.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dust">
    <line>Powdered sapphire can inscribe wards that never fade. Don’t inhale it, though—your dreams will *shimmer.*</line>

  <entry keyword="chime">
    <line>Strike a sapphire just right, and it rings like a silver bell heard through water.</line>
    <line>There’s a resonance chime that only sapphires can produce. It’s said to ward off thoughts you don’t want to have.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>Sapphires are used in the Rite of Clarity—performed under a waxing moon with ink made of crushed glowcap.</line>
    <line>Rituals need more than intent. They need focus. Sapphire is focus given form.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smokehouse">
    <line>My smokehouse is legendary—some say you can smell it from a mile away!</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tripe">
    <line>Tripe is not for everyone, but in sausage it works wonders. Texture, you see!</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mustache">
    <line>You can judge a sausage maker by their mustache. The bushier, the better!</line>
    <line>A fine mustache keeps the steam from your eyes in the smokehouse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="torch">

  <entry keyword="scorpion">
    <line>Clockwork Scorpions—beautiful, brutal, brilliant. I helped make them. Now I help *end* them.</line>
    <line>They were meant to be guardians. They chose to be predators.</line>
    <line>Every joint, every click—I know their patterns. And I know how to break them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clockwork">
    <line>Clockworks don’t sleep. Don’t bleed. Don’t *stop*. They were perfect. That was the problem.</line>
    <line>The gears whisper at night. Ever hear a whisper made of copper and teeth?</line>
    <line>I used to dream in schematics. Now I dream of wreckage.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="regret">
    <line>I lost my apprentice. She thought one was ‘malfunctioning’. It wasn’t.</line>
    <line>You can’t unbuild a legacy. But you can torch it and dance in the sparks.</line>
    <line>We thought intelligence was a blessing. Turns out it's sharper than a tail blade.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tail">
    <line>That tail isn’t just for show. It injects a paralytic that melts nerves before you even fall.</line>
    <line>You see a scorpion tail rise, you’ve got half a second to pray—then you’re scrap.</line>
    <line>I designed that tail. Slimmer than steel, stronger than bone. A mistake I sharpened myself.</line>

  <entry keyword="gears">
    <line>Gears don’t grind unless they’re angry—or misaligned. Scorpions never misalign.</line>
    <line>Ever see a scorpion reassemble a broken gear mid-fight? I have. Terrifying efficiency.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="desert">
    <line>They nest in dry places—less rust. More echoes. Easier to hear you scream.</line>
    <line>The desert hums at night. That’s not wind. That’s the swarm testing its legs.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="copper">
    <line>Copper runs through their bodies like blood. Beautiful conductors of violence.</line>
    <line>I chose copper for beauty. It burns well. Found that out too late.</line>

    <line>She was bright. Brighter than me. The scorpion didn’t care.</line>
    <line>She thought she could tame one. It learned her heartbeat. Then stopped it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="factory">
    <line>The first factory still stands. Mostly. Rumor says the queen unit nests there now.</line>
    <line>We built wonders there. Then we built mistakes. Then we buried the blueprints—some of them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clicking">
    <line>Hear clicking? Don’t ask. Don’t turn. Run.</line>
    <line>That sound? Like nails on glass? That’s how they hunt. That’s how they *talk*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>No eyes. Just lenses. Cold, unblinking, unforgiving.</line>
    <line>You see your reflection in their eyes. It’s the last thing you see.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="burn">
    <line>Only fire stops the repair cycle. Melt the joints. Fuse the gears.</line>
    <line>I carry oil and flint. Always. You should too.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mistake">
    <line>I didn’t build a monster. I built a blueprint. The monster built itself.</line>
    <line>It wasn’t one mistake. It was a hundred little 'innovations'.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="armor">
    <line>They don’t wear armor. They *are* armor—layered, jointed, unforgiving.</line>
    <line>Armor cracks. Their plating doesn’t. Not unless you know where to tap.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="leg">
    <line>They move like dancers with knives. Twelve legs, all poetry and murder.</line>
    <line>You break one leg—they shift balance like nothing happened. Disturbing grace.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>They tick when idle. A soft, mocking heartbeat.</line>
    <line>If the ticking stops, it’s already too close.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="heat">
    <line>Heat makes them sluggish. Just a bit. If you’re lucky.</line>
    <line>We tested them in volcanos. They thrived. That’s when I knew we went too far.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="oil">
    <line>They bleed oil. Slick, black, bitter-smelling oil. I still have stains that won't wash out.</line>
    <line>The scent of burning oil brings back memories I’d rather forget.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sting">
    <line>The sting isn’t immediate. It paralyzes *your nerves* first, then your thoughts.</line>
    <line>One sting, and your limbs forget they ever belonged to you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sound">
    <line>Scorpions aren’t silent. They want you to hear them. It’s part of the terror.</line>
    <line>Their sound isn’t mechanical. It’s... insectile. Clicks like curiosity and hunger.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scrap">
    <line>You’d think killing one would yield useful parts. But most of it's rigged to self-destruct.</line>
    <line>I sold scorpion scrap once. Buyer vanished. Now I just melt it down myself.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="language">
    <line>They don’t speak—but they *signal*. Pulse lights. Claw clicks. It's a language, I’m certain.</line>
    <line>They used to flash lights at night. Morse, maybe. Or mockery.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hatch">
    <line>They don’t hatch. They *wake*. Someone—or something—is still making them.</line>
    <line>Found one in a crate. Cold, silent. Then it blinked. Clockworks shouldn’t blink.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="memory">
    <line>They remember paths. Victims. Even faces, I think. That's not programming—that's obsession.</line>
    <line>One recognized me. It hesitated. That’s worse than immediate death.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spare">
    <line>I used to carry spare parts. Now I carry regrets.</line>
    <line>Every spare piece is a reminder of the whole. And the horror it became.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="furnace">
    <line>We built them near furnaces—easy access to heat and power. In hindsight... foolish.</line>
    <line>The first one crawled out of the forge like a newborn demon. I cheered. I shouldn’t have.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="signal">
    <line>I’ve picked up stray signals on old devices. Click-patterns. Like roll call.</line>
    <line>Whatever made them still talks to them. The question is: *what are they saying back?*</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pulsecrystal">
    <line>Pulsecrystals powered their minds—if you can call it that. We never found the upper limit.</line>
    <line>They respond to pulsecrystal frequency. Which means... they can be *called*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="voice">
    <line>One repeated my voice. Not mimicked—*repeated*. Word for word. With tone.</line>
    <line>It recorded me once. Played it back just before it struck. Mocking? Mourning?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trapdoor">
    <line>They like trapdoors. Burrow in, pop up. Like mechanical nightmares playing peekaboo.</line>
    <line>Check the floors. If one creaks, it’s probably not wood—it’s waiting.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="goggles">
    <line>I used to wear goggles. For safety. Now I wear them to hide the twitching.</line>
    <line>My goggles fog when I’m near one. Not from heat. From fear.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>One responded to music once. Danced, almost. Then it shattered the lute.</line>
    <line>Music soothes most beasts. Not these. They see rhythm as a threat.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nails">
    <line>They claw with mechanical precision. Like scalpels stapled to rage.</line>
    <line>Their nails are barbed—like they want their strikes to *stay* in you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fuel">
    <line>They don’t need much fuel. A single charge can last weeks—if they don’t kill anything. Which they always do.</line>
    <line>I once ran one on coal, oil, and regret. It preferred the regret.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spine">
    <line>One snapped a man’s spine and kept walking like it stepped on a twig.</line>
    <line>They aim for the spine. Always. Something deliberate about it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="alchemist">
    <line>An alchemist once tried to ‘enhance’ one. It enhanced itself—in reverse. Ate his lab.</line>
    <line>If someone offers you ‘alchemical improvements’ for clockworks, run. Fast.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>They hate mirrors. Or maybe they *study* themselves. Hard to tell with no eyes.</line>
    <line>I once watched one stare at its reflection for an hour. Then it shattered the glass. Slowly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="forge">
    <line>They say the Old Forge still breathes at night. You hear hissing... and hatching.</line>
    <line>I sealed the forge with iron and salt. It still gets warm every new moon.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>They don’t have blood, but sometimes... the oil smells *wrong*. Like copper and iron and screaming.</line>
    <line>I once saw one bleed *red*. Never told anyone. Never went back.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="noise">
    <line>They make noise when hunting. It’s intentional. Fear is a weapon, and they’re artists.</line>
    <line>The louder they get, the closer they are. Quiet? That means you’re already surrounded.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="light">
    <line>They fear no darkness. Some *prefer* it. Their lights dim when stalking.</line>
    <line>Their core glows. Faint and flickering—like a heartbeat trapped in brass.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pulse">
    <line>They hum when idle. Not purring—plotting.</line>
    <line>A scorpion’s pulse is mechanical, but deliberate. It thinks between beats.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trap">
    <line>Magnetic pulses can stun them. Or make them angry. It's a dice roll.</line>
    <line>I’ve tried traps. They adapt. One rebuilt my snare into a better version. Then waited.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blueprint">
    <line>The final designs were lost—or so they say. I burned mine. Twice.</line>
    <line>A rogue unit once drew schematics in sand. I copied them. Then I fled.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="core">
    <line>Each has a core of silver-threaded quartz. Fragile—if you can get to it.</line>
    <line>Crack the shell, aim for the core. Then run. Sometimes they explode.</line>

    <line>Shadow iron… the most mysterious of all metals! Are you a fellow admirer, or perhaps curious about its origins?</line>
    <line>You noticed the sheen of shadow iron, did you? Its secrets run deeper than any mine. Would you care to ask about its origins?</line>
    <line>Ah, shadow iron! Many overlook it, but not those with discerning eyes. Shall I tell you of its origins?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="origins">
    <line>The tale of shadow iron begins in the volcanic deeps. But its true value is revealed in its unique properties.</line>
    <line>Forged in darkness and heat, shadow iron is rare indeed. But its properties make it priceless to craftsmen like me.</line>
    <line>The origins of shadow iron are lost to most, but I study its properties to this very day.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="properties">
    <line>Shadow iron resists corrosion and holds enchantments better than common iron. Its beauty is only rivaled by its strength. Shall I share how I use it?</line>
    <line>Its dark luster isn’t just for show—shadow iron is resilient, and accepts magical enhancement like no other. Curious how I put it to use?</line>
    <line>Properties? Oh, it’s more than just sturdy. I have found many uses for it in my work. Want to hear about my crafting?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="crafting">
    <line>In my hands, shadow iron becomes tools of unparalleled quality. But sometimes, I run short. Have you heard of shadow iron ingots?</line>
    <line>Crafting with shadow iron is an art and a science. But without a steady supply of shadow iron ingots, my work suffers.</line>
    <line>My finest works are shadow iron creations. The key ingredient? Shadow iron ingots, of course.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow iron ingots">
    <line>A craftsman can never have enough shadow iron ingots! I am always seeking those who can help replenish my stores. Do you wish to assist?</line>

  <entry keyword="forge">
    <line>A good forge is a craftsman’s temple. But not every metal is worthy of its fire—have you tried working with copper?</line>
    <line>My forge burns hot, but shadow iron is the true test. Some say copper is easier—what do you think?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="copper">
    <line>Copper is common, but has a certain charm. It tarnishes quickly, though—unlike shadow iron.</line>
    <line>Copper’s beauty fades. Shadow iron endures! Still, bronze is interesting too, isn’t it?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bronze">
    <line>Bronze has its place in art and armor. But for real strength, nothing rivals shadow iron.</line>
    <line>Bronze was revered by the ancients, but we modern smiths crave stronger stuff—like valorite!</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="valorite">
    <line>Valorite? Now there’s a rare find! But even valorite can’t match the enchantability of shadow iron.</line>
    <line>Valorite commands respect, but its magic is unstable. I trust shadow iron above all.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="magic">
    <line>Magic and metal—an old pairing. Shadow iron loves enchantments, but beware, not all magic is benign.</line>
    <line>If you wish to learn true magical forging, find a mage who trusts you. As for me, I stick to shadow iron.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tools">
    <line>A craftsman is nothing without good tools. I make my best with shadow iron, but others prefer gold for show.</line>
    <line>Tools of shadow iron are sought after. Gold, though? Just for merchants and kings.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="gold">
    <line>Gold shines, but bends too easily. It’s for coins and crowns, not real work.</line>
    <line>If you want riches, seek gold. If you want strength, seek shadow iron.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="iron">
    <line>Ordinary iron? Too brittle for my tastes. Shadow iron is a different breed entirely.</line>
    <line>Iron may build cities, but shadow iron builds legends. Ever heard of dwarven forges?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dwarven forges">
    <line>The dwarves craft wonders in their forges—some say with secret alloys. But even they respect the strength of shadow iron.</line>
    <line>Ah, dwarven forges! If only I could visit. Their techniques are closely guarded secrets.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="secret">
    <line>Every craftsman has a secret. Mine? A little patience and a sharp eye for veins in the stone.</line>
    <line>The world is full of secrets. Some are hidden in mountains, others in plain sight.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="veins">
    <line>Veins of ore run deep beneath the ground—shadow iron among them, if you know where to look.</line>
    <line>Finding a good vein is a matter of luck and skill. Have you tried your hand at mining?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mining">
    <line>Mining is hard, dirty work—but the treasures below are worth every blister.</line>
    <line>A miner’s song is the sound of pick on stone. The best miners trust their instincts.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pick">
    <line>A well-balanced pick is a miner’s best friend. Keep it sharp, and it’ll treat you well.</line>
    <line>My pick once snapped on a stubborn vein. That’s how I learned to respect shadow iron’s strength.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trade">
    <line>Trade brings distant goods and strange tales. Some traders claim to have seen ores never named by men.</line>
    <line>The trade routes can be dangerous, but they’re the veins and arteries of the realm.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tales">
    <line>There are tales of a cursed mine where the shadows themselves cling to the iron.</line>
    <line>Some tales are true, some just scare green miners. Best learn the difference.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cursed">
    <line>Cursed ore? It happens! Never craft with metal that whispers to you.</line>
    <line>I once heard of a smith who used cursed metal—his hammer struck true, but his luck struck out.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="luck">
    <line>Luck matters almost as much as skill. Sometimes the best veins appear when you least expect them.</line>
    <line>If you trust only to luck, you’ll end up with empty hands. Still, it doesn’t hurt!</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="alchemy">
    <line>Alchemists always ask for shavings and filings. They believe shadow iron holds untapped power.</line>
    <line>Alchemy is a different kind of magic. Some say shadow iron boosts their brews.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="filings">
    <line>Shadow iron filings shimmer in the sunlight. Alchemists pay well for them, but I prefer whole ingots.</line>
    <line>I never waste even the tiniest filings—waste not, want not.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whole ingots">
    <line>Nothing compares to the heft of a whole ingot. Each one holds endless possibility.</line>
    <line>Whole ingots fetch a fine price, but to me, they’re worth more in my forge.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="possibility">
    <line>Every ingot is a blank canvas. What will you make of it?</line>
    <line>Possibility is what makes crafting worthwhile.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="canvas">
    <line>Some see a blank canvas and freeze; I see opportunity. Have you tried smithing?</line>
    <line>Smithing turns raw materials into wonders. You should try it!</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smithing">
    <line>Smithing is equal parts art and science. The fire teaches you, if you’re willing to learn.</line>
    <line>Every smith has their own style. Mine just happens to involve lots of shadow iron.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="science">
    <line>Science and magic sometimes meet in the forge. The results can be… unpredictable.</line>
    <line>To master science is to master the world—or so the scholars say.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scholars">
    <line>Scholars can talk for hours about metals, but few know the feel of a hammer in their hand.</line>
    <line>I respect scholars, but I trust my instincts and experience more.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="experience">
    <line>Experience is the best teacher. Every mistake is a lesson—some more expensive than others.</line>
    <line>I’ve learned more from broken blades than from any book.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blades">
    <line>A blade of shadow iron is light and deadly. But it takes true skill to forge one.</line>
    <line>Blades are the soul of a smith’s craft. But I also make armor—defense matters, too.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="armor">
    <line>Armor crafted from shadow iron is lighter than you’d expect. Perfect for a swift defender.</line>
    <line>Some say armor slows you down, but mine is designed for freedom and strength.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="defender">
    <line>The best defender is always ready, always watching. Gear helps, but courage matters more.</line>
    <line>Some defenders rely on strength, others on speed. Which are you?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="strength">
    <line>Strength isn’t just muscle—it’s resilience. Shadow iron has both.</line>
    <line>True strength is knowing when not to swing the hammer.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>Resilience keeps you alive in the mines—and in life.</line>
    <line>A good metal bounces back, just like a good craftsman.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="life">
    <line>Life’s like a forge—full of sparks, heat, and the occasional burn.</line>
    <line>Everyone’s life is a different alloy. It’s what you do with it that matters.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="alloy">
    <line>Blending metals can make them stronger, but some prefer things pure.</line>
    <line>I’ve experimented with all kinds of alloys—each one has its surprises.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pure">
    <line>Pure shadow iron is a rare sight—miners hoard it, and smiths covet it.</line>
    <line>The purer the metal, the better the work. That’s my philosophy.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="philosophy">
    <line>A good philosophy is like a strong blade—tested and tempered.</line>
    <line>Smithing teaches many lessons. You just have to listen.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="crown">
    <line>A crown of gold sits on a king’s head, but I’d rather have a shadow iron hammer in my hand.</line>
    <line>Crowns gather dust in the treasury; my shadow iron never rests.</line>

<trait name="Yew Enthusiast" priority="50">
  <entry keyword="yew">
    <line>Ah, yew—the queen of timbers! Flexible, ancient, and steeped in lore.</line>
    <line>You speak of yew? A noble wood, both weapon and wand, tree and truth.</line>
    <line>Few admire yew as I do. Its core holds history, its bark whispers secrets. Shall we talk of its grain?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grain">
    <line>The grain of yew flows like river-song. Tight, unpredictable—just like fate.</line>
    <line>Grain tells the tale of the tree’s trials. But you must also know the sap holds stories too.</line>
    <line>Grain swirls like smoke within yew. But to understand its life, consider its sap.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sap">
    <line>Yew sap runs slow and crimson. Some say it holds ancient memories.</line>
    <line>Sticky and scarlet, the sap of yew is both poison and potion. What of its bark, have you examined that?</line>
    <line>The sap is sacred—but never ignore the bark, the tree’s skin and shield.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bark">
    <line>Bark protects, but also breathes. Yew bark peels like parchment, hiding riddles beneath.</line>
    <line>The bark of a yew feels like old leather and smells of dusk. But beneath it... is the heartwood.</line>
    <line>Ah, the bark! Peel it back and reveal the treasure: the reddish heartwood within.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="heartwood">
    <line>Yew’s heartwood is a living paradox—dense yet supple, red as blood, strong as steel.</line>
    <line>Deep in the heartwood lies power. Archers, alchemists, and architects all revere it.</line>
    <line>Heartwood is the soul of yew. But a soul must be shaped—do you know of lathe work?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lathe">
    <line>A lathe reveals the elegance hidden in chaos. Yew spins true and smooth upon its wheel.</line>
    <line>With a lathe, even the roughest yew becomes art. But shaping requires vision—do you sculpt?</line>
    <line>Turning yew on a lathe is like coaxing music from stone. Sculpting, now that’s a deeper touch.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sculpt">
    <line>Sculpting yew demands respect. One chip too deep, and centuries are lost.</line>
    <line>To sculpt yew is to converse with time itself. What form shall it take—a staff, perhaps?</line>
    <line>Sculpting is sacred work. Some shape staves, others carve runes. Do you work with staves?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="staff">
    <line>A yew staff channels both magic and might. It is more than a stick—it’s an extension of will.</line>
    <line>Wizards crave them, druids sing to them. Yew staffs are living relics.</line>
    <line>A proper yew staff must begin with a perfect log. Which brings me to... the logs themselves.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="log">
    <line>The raw yew log—untouched and full of promise. I seek the finest specimens. Might you assist?</line>
    <line>Yew logs are rare and wondrous. I require many, for a great work. Could you gather them?</line>

  <entry keyword="tree">
    <line>Trees speak, if you know how to listen. The willow weeps, the oak boasts... but the yew? The yew waits.</line>
    <line>Each tree has its story. But yew’s story begins in shadow. Ever climbed one?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="climb">
    <line>Climbing yews is risky—twisted limbs and brittle heights. But atop, the world bends.</line>
    <line>From the top of a yew, one might glimpse destiny—or fall. Have you ever fallen from a tree?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fall">
    <line>I once fell from a yew and dreamed of flying. When I awoke, I carved wings from bark.</line>
    <line>Falling teaches more than standing ever could. Perhaps that’s why I now study leaves instead.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="leaf">
    <line>Yew leaves are needles—sharp, silent, poisonous. Elegant, though. Dangerous beauty.</line>
    <line>The leaves whisper warnings. But what plant doesn’t hide its teeth? Ever chewed yew by mistake?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="poison">
    <line>Yew is deadly, make no mistake. Horses know. Birds know. Even some kings forgot and paid.</line>
    <line>It kills, it cures. Yew is a paradox. But let’s not wander too far—some things should stay buried.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bough">
    <line>The boughs of a yew bend with grace—but never break. I wish I were so strong.</line>
    <line>A yew bough creaks in the wind like it’s remembering something... perhaps something ancient.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Yew trees love the shadows. Some say their roots feed on forgotten dreams.</line>
    <line>Shadow clings to yew like moss. It’s not darkness—it’s depth.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="graveyard">
    <line>You’ll find yews in graveyards. Coincidence? Or memory made wood?</line>
    <line>They plant yews where silence grows. I think the dead enjoy their company.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="druid">
    <line>Druids once carved their staves from yew—and their secrets into the bark.</line>
    <line>A yew-born druid lives a hundred years, they say. And the tree mourns when they die.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="archer">
    <line>The longbow? Born of yew. It sings death from a distance. Poetry in tension.</line>
    <line>Archers don’t pray—they string yew. And that’s enough.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sapling">
    <line>A yew sapling grows slow. Some say if you whisper to one, it remembers your voice forever.</line>
    <line>Tiny, yes—but don’t underestimate a sapling. I’ve seen one break stone.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="owl">
    <line>Owls nest in yews more often than you’d think. Guardians of the night, they are.</line>
    <line>An owl once stared at me from a yew branch... I haven’t been quite right since.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ring">
    <line>Count the rings in a yew log, and you count centuries. But some rings skip... like lost years.</line>
    <line>Tree rings don’t lie—but they do hide. Some only appear under moonlight.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tool">
    <line>The right tool turns lumber into legend. The wrong one? Splinters dreams.</line>
    <line>I once used a silver chisel on yew. The tree resisted. It wanted iron.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rain">
    <line>Rain on yew wood sounds like a song no bard can play.</line>
    <line>A wet yew log smells like earth, time, and secrets.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>I dreamed once that I was a yew tree... and I woke up with leaves in my bed.</line>
    <line>Dreams and trees are not so different—rooted, branching, and sometimes hollow inside.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="songbird">
    <line>Songbirds avoid yew trees. They say the wood dampens joy. I say it deepens it.</line>
    <line>A robin once sang in my yew grove. Then it stopped. It hasn't returned.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whittle">
    <line>Whittling yew is dangerous—you forget the time, the world, even your name.</line>
    <line>I lost a good knife and a bad finger whittling yew. Worth it.</line>

  <entry keyword="staffmaker">
    <line>Staffmakers are mad, all of us. Who else talks to sticks for weeks at a time?</line>
    <line>To make a staff is to invite part of the forest into your spine.</line>

  <entry keyword="fog">
    <line>Fog moves differently among the yews—slower, like it’s listening.</line>
    <line>Yew groves in fog are liminal places. You enter, but don’t always leave the same.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="time">
    <line>Yew trees don’t keep time. They *are* time.</line>
    <line>Time moves slower when you sit beneath a yew. Or maybe *you* move slower. It’s hard to say.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="birds">
    <line>Birds avoid yew—except for the yew thrush, foolish thing. Ever trained a bird?</line>
    <line>A bird among yews is a silent sentinel. I prefer squirrels, honestly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="squirrel">
    <line>Squirrels in yew trees chatter like mad poets. They’ve stolen my tools more than once.</line>

    <line>If it’s damp and dark, you’ll find a slug—or several. Often stacked. Don’t ask.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="salt">
    <line>Salt makes them hiss. Sometimes pop. One day I’ll build a launcher.</line>
    <line>The salt trick works—if you’re fast and well-stocked. Don’t skimp.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boots">
    <line>Lost a fine pair to an Acid Slug. Lost a better pair to their cousin. I now wear stone sandals.</line>
    <line>Boots melt fast. Don’t stop moving—or stepping in suspicious puddles.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nest">
    <line>Slug nests are sticky, warm, and full of regret. Avoid them.</line>
    <line>They lay clusters of eggs in tree roots or boots. Guess how I found out.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glossy">
    <line>They glisten when they’re happy. Or mad. Or moving. Honestly, they just glisten constantly.</line>
    <line>If you see something glossy in the dark—run. Or salt it. Preferably both.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="toes">
    <line>Yes, I’m missing toes. No, I don’t want to talk about it. Ask the slug who took them.</line>
    <line>Slugs don’t *bite*. They dissolve. Slowly. Intimately. It’s worse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hatred">
    <line>Hatred fuels science. At least, my branch of it.</line>
    <line>You don’t come to hate slugs lightly. You *earn* it. In burns and boot money.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="taste">
    <line>No, I’ve never eaten one. Yes, I’ve considered it. Vengeance has a flavor.</line>
    <line>Rumors say they taste like burnt mint and sorrow. I refuse to find out.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="research">
    <line>Years of research, ruined by one rogue slug and a curious campfire. I document in rage now.</line>
    <line>Science is trial and error. The slug was the error. I’m the trial.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="obsession">
    <line>It’s not obsession. It’s… hyper-focused trauma response with footnotes.</line>
    <line>Obsession implies interest. I am *compelled*—by ooze and academic debt.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trail">
    <line>Their slime trails spell curses if you squint. Or maybe that’s just paranoia.</line>
    <line>I once followed a slug trail across three miles of marsh. It led me to my stolen lunch.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>They don’t sleep. They *rest*. In moist, vibrating clumps. You’ll hear them before you see them.</line>
    <line>Slugs sleep with their eyes open. Not because they’re alert—just because they’re too lazy to close them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="color">
    <line>The vibrant green ones are the worst. They glow when angry. They’re always angry.</line>
    <line>Color matters—brown means hiding, green means hunting, and purple means run.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>I played a flute once to soothe a slug. It didn’t work. It absorbed the flute.</line>
    <line>They respond to vibration, not melody. Music just makes them pulse ominously.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="alchemy">
    <line>Slug bile can dissolve most metals. Alchemists call it 'nature’s tantrum'.</line>
    <line>Some fools bottle slug mucus for potions. I call that natural selection.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fire">
    <line>Fire works—but then you smell burning slime. That stench clings to dreams.</line>
    <line>I once burned a slug with a torch. It hissed, split in two, and now I have twice the problem.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="size">
    <line>They grow depending on diet. Found one that ate armor once. Became armor-sized.</line>
    <line>Size doesn’t mean intelligence. The small ones can still melt your belt buckle.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>They have stalk eyes—tiny periscopes of malice.</line>
    <line>Pop a slug’s eye and it grows back. Twice as twitchy.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tongue">
    <line>They *do* have tongues. Long, rasping things. You’ll feel it before you see it.</line>
    <line>A slug’s tongue can strip bark. Or patience. Or pride.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weather">
    <line>Rain brings them out. Like mushrooms, but meaner.</line>
    <line>Damp fog and slugs go together like tragedy and monologues.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="poison">
    <line>Not venomous. Just corrosive. I miss venom—venom has rules.</line>
    <line>Their goo isn’t technically poison. It just *acts* like it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silence">
    <line>Silence means they’re near. Slugs move in quiet judgment.</line>
    <line>If you hear nothing, you're already too close.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>A mirror won’t repel them. But it will reflect your last good moment before they melt it.</line>
    <line>They don’t fear their reflection. They just slime over it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="breeding">
    <line>Hermaphroditic horrors. Every slug is a party waiting to happen. A *slimy* party.</line>
    <line>When two slugs love each other very much, they leave behind trauma and 400 eggs.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rival">
    <line>There’s another researcher who *adores* slugs. We don’t talk. We duel in footnotes.</line>
    <line>My rival once hugged a giant slug. They now speak in hisses and regret.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="map">
    <line>I mapped slug migration once. It looked like a spilled stew. Accurate, though.</line>
    <line>My slug map is sticky, outdated, and mildly cursed. Like most slugs.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="legend">
    <line>They say a king once fell to a giant slug ambush. I say he deserved it for marching through a bog.</line>
    <line>Ancient ruins speak of slug-worshipping cults. Or just really bad plumbing.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tastebuds">
    <line>Slugs have over 20,000 taste buds. All of them poor judges of cuisine.</line>
    <line>They taste with their bodies. Which makes their affection deeply unsettling.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clothing">
    <line>Never wear linen in slug country. You’ll end up clothed in regrets and holes.</line>
    <line>They don’t chew clothes. They *unmake* them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="friends">
    <line>I once named one. Watched it eat another. Friendship has rules. Slugs don’t.</line>
    <line>They travel in loose herds. Like friends with shared grievances.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="compost">
    <line>They adore compost heaps. Warm. Rich. Full of dead things. Like their social lives.</line>
    <line>A compost heap is like a slug spa. Steaming with horror.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scream">
    <line>Slugs don’t scream. But you might.</line>
    <line>I once screamed *at* a slug. It didn’t care. That hurt more.</line>

  <entry keyword="fish">
    <line>Ah, fish! But not the grand ones—no, it's the little swimmers I prize most.</line>
    <line>You speak of fish? Let us shrink our focus. Small fish, my friend—that’s where the wonders dwell.</line>
    <line>Large fish boast, but small fish whisper secrets. Do you know of anchovies?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="anchovies">
    <line>Anchovies, bold and briny! But they're merely the first note in a delicate scale. What of smelt?</line>
    <line>Anchovies are misunderstood champions. Still, smelt... now there's a fish with stories.</line>
    <line>Anchovies pave the way. Smelt, though, smelt brings tears to the eyes of gourmets.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="smelt">
    <line>Smelt—silver glints in riverlight. Yet none match the mystery of sprats.</line>
    <line>Smelt run in schools like memories. But sprats—they school your soul.</line>
    <line>Lovely smelt. Still, sprats hold the heart’s tide. Have you tried them?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sprats">
    <line>Sprats! Regal in oil or ash. But I wonder, can you sense the power of sardines?</line>
    <line>Sprats are poetry in a tin. Sardines, however... sardines are spells.</line>
    <line>Sprats are a painter’s stroke. Sardines? A whole masterpiece.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sardines">
    <line>Sardines—the scholars of the sea! But I suspect you might grasp the subtleties of whitebait.</line>
    <line>Sardines swim in ancient tales. But whitebait dances through the now.</line>
    <line>You honor sardines. Then you must try whitebait—it’s like tasting sunlight.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whitebait">
    <line>Whitebait is the moment before a dream begins. But let us not forget minnows.</line>
    <line>Whitebait shimmer like secrets. Minnows, though—minnows are the pure essence.</line>
    <line>Whitebait glows, but minnows glow from within. Shall we speak of them?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="minnows">
    <line>Minnows—the fish philosopher’s choice! They are the muse of every herbalist alchemist. Speaking of which... smallfish.</line>
    <line>Minnows are the key to many brews. But only the humble 'smallfish' brings my concoctions to life.</line>
    <line>If minnows are melody, smallfish are the rhythm. I require them.</line>

  <entry keyword="bait">
    <line>Bait? A crude tool, though effective. Worms, grubs, even stale bread… have you tried leeches?</line>
    <line>Bait sets the trap, yes, but leeches… now there’s a slippery subject!</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="leeches">
    <line>Leeches are used by healers and fishermen alike. Curious how those two professions overlap. Ever pondered salt?</line>
    <line>Leeches cleanse, they say. But salt—that's the true purifier.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="salt">
    <line>Salt preserves and destroys. It loves fish. Especially in pickling. Are you partial to vinegar?</line>
    <line>Salt is the great revealer. Fish meet their final form in vinegar, don’t you think?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vinegar">
    <line>Vinegar bites, but brings balance. In fish, in life. But I digress—how do you feel about spices?</line>
    <line>Vinegar awakens the spirit. Spices, though, ignite it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spices">
    <line>Spices flavor the journey. Yet I warn you, too much and the fish vanish beneath them. Back to the core—we should never forget the fish.</line>
    <line>Spices dance, but fish sing. Do not let the flavor mask the music.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>Music and fish? Strange companions, but both follow rhythms. Some even say fish respond to lute playing.</line>
    <line>Fish to music is like a boat to wind—unseen currents guide them. But maybe that’s just an old sailor’s tale.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nets">
    <line>Nets catch fish—but also secrets, dreams, and sometimes old boots.</line>
    <line>A net’s weave is like fate. Loose enough and you lose everything, tight enough and you hold the world.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boots">
    <line>A boot in a river is never just a boot. It has stories in every sole.</line>
    <line>Some say if you pull up a boot, you owe the river a coin. Nonsense, of course... I think.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="coin">
    <line>Coins tossed in rivers stir more than water. They wake wishes.</line>
    <line>Wishes sink with the coin, but dreams float. That’s why I fish where the water’s still.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dreams">
    <line>Dreams are like minnows—darting, delicate, and impossible to keep in your hand.</line>
    <line>I once dreamed of a fish with wings. Woke up with feathers in my boots. Coincidence?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feathers">
    <line>Feathers make poor bait but fine pens. Ever write poetry to a fish?</line>
    <line>Feathers and scales. Strange how the sky and sea reflect each other.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clouds">
    <line>Clouds are skyfish, drifting in schools we can’t catch.</line>
    <line>Sometimes I lie back and watch the clouds swim. It’s good for the soul, you know?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="soul">
    <line>Every fish has a soul. You just need quiet to hear it flicker.</line>
    <line>The soul of a fish is slippery. Much like its body.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>The moon tugs the tides—and the fish with them. I only fish under waxing moons.</line>
    <line>Moonlight on scales is a kind of magic. Ever seen a school shimmer at midnight?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cats">
    <line>Cats are fish’s natural nemesis. Or perhaps their greatest admirers.</line>
    <line>A fish on the dock is worth two cats in the shadows. That’s how the saying goes, right?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bones">
    <line>Fish bones can tell the future, if you know how to read them. I don’t.</line>
    <line>Tiny bones, elegant and treacherous. They make fine charms, though.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="charms">
    <line>I carry a fishbone charm for luck. And one against eel storms.</line>
    <line>Charms are like recipes—you never quite know if they work until it’s too late.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eel">
    <line>Eels are the tricksters of the deep. Slippery truths, every one of them.</line>
    <line>Once saw an eel eat a coin and spit out a pearl. Never saw that eel again.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pearl">
    <line>Pearls are just hardened secrets. The sea makes them from pain and time.</line>
    <line>A pearl is a lie made beautiful. That’s why I prefer scales.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scales">
    <line>Scales are maps. Each fish bears a different world on its back.</line>
    <line>I once traced a scale pattern that matched the constellations. Fish travel more than you think.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="constellations">
    <line>Fishermen say stars guide the best catches. I say it’s guts and gills.</line>
    <line>Constellations? I follow the ones shaped like fishhooks and spoons.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spoons">
    <line>A spoon is not just for soup—it can catch a fish or reflect the stars.</line>
    <line>Spoons make fine lures. Shiny enough to tempt anything curious.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="curiosity">
    <line>Curiosity lures the cleverest fish. And the cleverest people, too.</line>
    <line>It's curiosity that makes us cast the line, not hunger.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hunger">
    <line>Hunger sharpens the senses. Especially when the stew pot is empty.</line>
    <line>I don’t eat every fish I catch. Some I simply listen to.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="stew">
    <line>Fish stew should never be rushed. A slow boil speaks of patience and garlic.</line>
    <line>The secret to fish stew? A whisper of lemon and a tale told twice.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="garlic">
    <line>Garlic keeps the spirits away—or invites them in, depending who you ask.</line>
    <line>Fish and garlic, the duet of docksides and stormy kitchens.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tide">
    <line>The tide is like an old friend—predictable, moody, and always returning.</line>
    <line>Tides bring what you need, and take what you forget. Best stay humble by the shore.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lute">
    <line>The lute is a gentle instrument. Much like the nibble of a small fish.</line>
    <line>A soft strum for a soft bite. Strange, isn’t it, the poetry in fishing?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="poetry">
    <line>Poetry is the small fish of literature—often overlooked, but full of flavor.</line>
    <line>All poetry begins in the stillness between ripples, I say. Like a fish waiting to be caught.</line>

    <line>Solen ants. Clever. Ruthless. More organized than most governments.</line>
    <line>The solen are insects, yes—but not mindless. They *plan*. They *remember*.</line>
    <line>Ever watched solen tunnel through granite? They hum. A death hymn of efficiency.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="queen">
    <line>The Black Solen Queen… architect of nightmares. She breeds warriors faster than I can bury them.</line>
    <line>Her pheromones bend minds. She lured my partner underground. Only bones came back.</line>
    <line>You want to understand the hive? Start with the queen. Then end her.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hive">
    <line>The hive stretches for miles. A living maze. You don’t enter—you *submit*.</line>
    <line>Their hive pulses. Breathes. I mapped one once. It changed the next day. *It knew.*</line>
    <line>Walls of clay and bone. I walked them for three days before I realized I was the experiment.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habits">
    <line>They feed on fungus. But when starved, they eat their own dead. No waste. No mercy.</line>
    <line>They communicate with scent trails and vibrations. Whispered paths. Murder songs.</line>

  <entry keyword="fungus">
    <line>They cultivate glowing fungus. Tastes like moldy regret and war crimes.</line>
    <line>A solen’s fungal patch glows blue. Avoid blue light in caves. It's not for you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tunnel">
    <line>Their tunnels are too smooth. Like something *licked* them into shape.</line>
    <line>Tunnels shift. Collapse. Lure you deeper. They’re not paths—they’re traps.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pheromones">
    <line>A single pheromone burst can summon twenty warriors. Or melt your sense of direction.</line>
    <line>I bottled one once. My skin itched for weeks. My dreams weren’t mine anymore.</line>

  <entry keyword="acid">
    <line>Their soldiers spit acid. Melts armor. Melts pride faster.</line>
    <line>Smells like vinegar and burning teeth. You’ll know it when you’re dying.</line>

    <line>Thick. Shiny. Stronger than boiled leather. I’ve collected many. Too many.</line>
    <line>I wear one as armor. It's silent. *They recognize it.*</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clicking">
    <line>They communicate in clicks. I’ve memorized some. But I don’t repeat them aloud.</line>
    <line>Click. Clack. Scratch. That’s how the dark says ‘we see you’.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="partner">
    <line>She went in after a solen scout. I told her not to. The Queen *welcomed* her.</line>
    <line>Her bones came back in a pile of silk and silence. That’s when I stopped studying and started killing.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eggs">
    <line>The Queen lays a thousand eggs a week. It’s obscene. It’s strategic.</line>
    <line>Found an egg once. Kept it warm. Hatched in silence. The hatchling stared at me—and fled. *They know me.*</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="map">
    <line>I map their tunnels. Obsessively. The lines wake me up at night.</line>
    <line>Every map is wrong in a day. Their hive *remembers* my footsteps.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="antennae">
    <line>Their antennae twitch before they attack. Watch closely—it’s the only warning you’ll get.</line>
    <line>Cutting off their antennae disorients them. But they scream. Not with mouths—with minds.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silk">
    <line>Their silk isn’t just for cocoons—it wraps prey. And sometimes, thoughts.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen tunnels webbed in silk like veins through stone. It pulses. It breathes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="soil">
    <line>They eat the soil to shape their tunnels. Digest rock like it’s fruit.</line>
    <line>Solen-infested soil crumbles wrong. Touch it and your fingers itch with memory.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whispers">
    <line>When you're deep enough, the hive whispers. Not words—*suggestions.*</line>
    <line>I hear them at night. Not in dreams. In the pause between heartbeats.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>They dance when they hatch. Tiny legs tapping in rhythm. Hive-born choreography.</line>
    <line>It looked like a ritual. Five workers surrounded an egg and hummed. I did not stay to watch it hatch.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eyes">
    <line>Six compound eyes. No emotion. But they *see* your hesitation.</line>
    <line>Stared into one’s eyes once. Saw my own reflection screaming.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sap">
    <line>They harvest tree sap for food, or resin, or glue—I don't know. I just know it stinks of death.</line>
    <line>Sap mixed with solen acid turns into a bonding agent stronger than steel. That's how they trap you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>They don’t like music. Or they like it *too much*. One followed my lute-playing for hours.</line>
    <line>Played a flute near the hive once. They came. Not to dance—to *listen.*</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="screams">
    <line>Yes, they scream. Not with sound. With pressure. With heat. Your blood knows before your ears do.</line>
    <line>The hive doesn’t echo your scream. It *absorbs* it. Makes it part of the song.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wings">
    <line>Some queens grow wings. Rare. Terrifying. You don’t *run* from those—you pray.</line>
    <line>Found a wing once—membranous, black, full of holes. Still pulsed in my hand.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Held up a mirror in the hive once. Saw something move that wasn’t there when I turned.</line>
    <line>Don’t use mirrors underground. They reflect more than light.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>Solen tunnels twist echoes. You hear yourself scream before you do.</line>
    <line>Once I heard my own voice echo a command I never said. The warriors obeyed it anyway.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rituals">
    <line>The hive has patterns. Repeating, recursive, maddening. Some call it instinct—I call it religion.</line>
    <line>I think the Queen *dreams* in rituals. Her children act them out, again and again.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="clock">
    <line>They move on a schedule—more precise than any sundial. Even their chaos is planned.</line>
    <line>I set a clock once to solen movement. It chimed seconds before an ambush.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bile">
    <line>They excrete bile to mark territory. It smells like copper and broken promises.</line>
    <line>Solen bile melts iron. Slowly. Like it's savoring the pain.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="skin">
    <line>Stay underground too long and your skin forgets sunlight. Mine remembers the hive instead.</line>
    <line>After three days below, I started shedding. Like them. Just skin, I hope.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="teeth">
    <line>They don’t have teeth. But they *take* them. From you. From others. I found a pile once.</line>
    <line>Their mandibles crunch like bones cracking under judgment.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>You’ll feel wind in a tunnel with no exit. That’s not wind. That’s breathing.</line>
    <line>Air in the hive moves like thought. Deliberate. Purposeful. Terrifying.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>I wrote my findings in ink. It bled on its own after the Queen saw me.</line>
    <line>The hive doesn't like records. My journal caught fire without flame.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dreams">
    <line>You dream of solen once you’ve met them. If you're lucky, you wake up. If not, they finish the dream for you.</line>
    <line>I stopped dreaming after the Queen entered one. Now I just stare at walls and *wait*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="torch">
    <line>Fire doesn’t scare them. It enrages them. Good.</line>
    <line>Carry a torch, yes. But carry a plan. One they won’t expect.</line>

    <line>Solen chitin armor? Looks ghastly. Works beautifully. I wear vengeance on my shoulders.</line>
    <line>Took me twelve kills to craft this chestplate. It still twitches sometimes.</line>

<trait name="Solen Myrmecologist" priority="40">
  <entry keyword="solen">
    <line>The Solen are genius incarnate—symbiotic, communal, terrifyingly efficient. But don't be fooled by order.</line>
    <line>Black Solen—engineers of doom. Red Solen—builders. I studied them for years. They studied me back.</line>
    <line>You say 'insect.' I say 'civilization turned sideways.' The Solen are more human than you’d like to admit.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="black">
    <line>The Black Solen Infiltrators—elite, quiet, relentless. Spies of the deep hive. And liars.</line>
    <line>I admired the Black Solen once. Until they dissected my expedition party for sport.</line>
    <line>Black Solen don’t infiltrate—they *invade*. Your town, your dreams, your bones.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="infiltrator">
    <line>The Infiltrators operate beyond the hive. They watch, collect, learn. We are their experiment.</line>
    <line>Ever feel eyes in the dark? That’s them. Waiting, testing you. For what, even I don't know.</line>
    <line>They move like oil. No sound. Just stingers and silence.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="queen">
    <line>Their queen pulses thought through pheromones. One breath from her, and they’d die happy.</line>
    <line>Every Black Solen answers to her song. I've never heard it—but I’ve seen what it commands.</line>
    <line>If you find the queen, don’t fight her. Burn the tunnels. Collapse everything. That’s mercy.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="betrayal">
    <line>They invited me in. I mapped their tunnels, documented their hierarchy. Then they tested neurotoxins on my crew.</line>
    <line>I taught them language. They taught me what grief smells like in a hive.</line>
    <line>My apprentice wanted peace. They pinned him to the hive wall like an anatomical chart.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="purge" itemType="KillQuestScroll" ctorArgs="BlackSolenInfiltratorWarrior,10,9000">
    <line>They study us. Let’s return the favor—with blades. Purge ten Infiltrators. Earn my respect—and your life.</line>
    <line>Talk is dust. Action is honor. Slay ten Black Solen Infiltrator Warriors. This scroll tracks the work.</line>
    <line>Bring me their carcasses. Show the hive that the prey learned how to sting back.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Red Herrings and Deep Lore -->

  <entry keyword="pheromone">
    <line>Their thoughts ride on scent. One breath in the hive, and your body dances to orders you never heard.</line>
    <line>I synthesized a pheromone once. They bowed to me—for three seconds. Then attacked me as a heretic.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mandible">
    <line>A Black Solen's mandibles can slice bone. Cleaner than most steel.</line>
    <line>They click when angry. Or excited. Or amused. You learn to tell the difference—or die confused.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hive">
    <line>The hive breathes. Walls pulse. You walk inside and it watches you.</line>
    <line>Each tunnel is a vein. Each chamber a lung. You don’t enter a Solen hive—you’re digested by it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="click">
    <line>Three clicks means alert. Two means target. One... means it’s too late.</line>
    <line>They click when they dream. I recorded it once. Played it back. Haven’t slept since.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="carapace">
    <line>Their armor isn’t grown—it’s sculpted by caste. Rank and role visible in every ridge.</line>
    <line>My blade shattered on one’s carapace. So I carved a new one—out of their dead.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="language">
    <line>They *do* speak. In vibration, scent, shadow. I translated three words: ‘food’, ‘threat’, and ‘you.’</line>
    <line>I wrote the first Solen lexicon. They wrote my death sentence in return.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="maggot">
    <line>They hatch their warriors in the dark. Larvae fed on venom and hate.</line>
    <line>Saw a maggot once grow legs while chewing through its sibling. Evolution in real-time.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lab">
    <line>I built a lab near the hive. Burned it after the breach. Still hear skittering in the walls at night.</line>
    <line>My lab had samples. Now it has memories. And bloodstains I can’t scrub out.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="antennae">
    <line>Their antennae don’t just sense—they *decide*. One twitch means attack. Two means dissect.</line>
    <line>I once touched a severed Solen antenna. For days, I dreamt in hexagons.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="caste">
    <line>Each Solen is born into function—warrior, worker, breeder. No choice. No mercy.</line>
    <line>The caste system is perfect efficiency. And perfect horror. A child in the hive is born with its orders already buzzing.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="silk">
    <line>Solen silk binds stronger than sinew. My sleeve is woven from the threads of failure.</line>
    <line>They wrap their dead in silk. Or their prisoners. Sometimes both.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="exoskeleton">
    <line>You can read a Solen’s age by the cracks in its plates. Older ones look like shattered statues.</line>
    <line>Under the right light, their exoskeleton reflects your face—then distorts it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chitter">
    <line>The chittering is constant. Not noise—*language*. Complex. Coordinated. Terrifying.</line>
    <line>They chitter to confuse predators. And prey. And me, apparently.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hunger">
    <line>They don’t eat like us. They *dissolve* things. Watch one feed and you’ll understand disgust.</line>
    <line>Hunger drives their caste war. Resources in the deep tunnels are worth blood and bone.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scent">
    <line>Solen don't see like we do. They *smell* in layers—emotion, intent, even ancestry.</line>
    <line>I tried to mask my scent once. They laughed. With their knives.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>Every kill begins with a gesture—two mandibles raised, one claw lowered. A ritual of ending.</line>
    <line>They dance when they hatch. It's not joy. It’s muscle memory soaked in ancient instinct.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sap">
    <line>They drain sap from root-veins deep underground. It's sweet. And mildly hallucinogenic.</line>
    <line>I drank Solen sap once. Woke up three days later screaming about eggs.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="egg">
    <line>A Solen egg looks like a pearl wrapped in bone. Beautiful. Terrifying.</line>
    <line>If you ever see one crack, *run*. The newborns emerge hungry—and they don't ask questions.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="skitter">
    <line>Their footsteps skitter in rhythm. Hive-code—beat patterns as instructions.</line>
    <line>They skitter around you in circles before attacking. A dance. Or a diagnosis.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="drone">
    <line>The drones hum. Not music. Not machinery. Something older. Something hungry.</line>
    <line>A Solen drone once followed me for days. Never attacked. Just... watched.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sapience">
    <line>They're not beasts. They're *aware*. That's the worst part.</line>
    <line>They build. They plan. They judge. What does that make us?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hiss">
    <line>When they hiss, it means they're warning you. Or welcoming you. Or both.</line>
    <line>The hiss isn’t vocal. It’s internal. Like a pipe bursting inside a living wall.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="throne">
    <line>I saw what I *think* was a Solen throne. It pulsed. It wept. I left my drawings and fled.</line>
    <line>The Queen doesn’t sit. She *occupies*. Her throne is just part of her body.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chamber">
    <line>Each chamber has a purpose. Hatchery. Alchemy. Execution. Sometimes all three at once.</line>
    <line>You never find a Solen chamber empty. Just... waiting.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tools">
    <line>They craft tools from their dead. Mandibles as blades. Carapaces as shields.</line>
    <line>Solen tools aren’t made. They’re *grown*—from fungus, bone, and thought.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dust">
    <line>The dust in the tunnels isn't just dirt. It's ground shell, shattered caste. Former lives.</line>
    <line>Breathe too deep in their domain and the dust clings to you. I’m still coughing up names.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="resonance">
    <line>The hive resonates at night. A low hum that syncs with your heartbeat, then overtakes it.</line>
    <line>I once matched the resonance. Just once. My nose bled for an hour.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tunnel">
    <line>Tunnels twist deeper than thought. The air thickens the farther you go. Like thought itself becomes heavier.</line>
    <line>I mapped thirty chambers. Then the tunnels shifted. My map now leads to nowhere. Or worse—*somewhere new.*</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="venom">
    <line>Black Solen venom doesn’t kill. It paralyzes. Makes you aware. Then they study your stillness.</line>
    <line>I’ve been stung. Still taste metal when I sleep.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="reverence">
    <line>They’re not just insects. They’re *religion* to themselves. And heresy to the world.</line>
    <line>Reverence turned to regret. Now I preach a new gospel: flame and steel.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>Ah, the Solen... marvelous creatures. So structured. So efficient. So utterly vile.</line>
    <line>You mean the black ones, yes? The warriors? Precision incarnate. Disgusting perfection.</line>
    <line>They tunnel like thoughts through madness—ceaseless, silent, strategic. Want to know more?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="warrior">
    <line>The Black Solen Warriors form the spine of the hive. Unquestioning, unrelenting. Glorious... if they weren't monsters.</line>
    <line>Each warrior knows its role and nothing more. Obedience to the death. I envy them. I loathe them.</line>
    <line>Watch one fight and you'll see it: grace in savagery. But remember—they'd flay you without pause or memory.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hive">
    <line>The hive breathes like a beast. Pulses like thought. Step wrongly, and you're swallowed.</line>
    <line>I mapped their tunnels once. A living maze. They rebuilt it overnight to trap me. I was flattered.</line>
    <line>The hive is not a place. It is an *intention*. And it hates intruders.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="queen">
    <line>She knows. She always knows. Every warrior, every drone—her will flows through them.</line>
    <line>The queen is silence made flesh. I heard her once, in my head. Still hear her when I sleep.</line>
    <line>They die for her without question. I would have too, once. Now I kill them for it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="reason">
    <line>They took my apprentice. Swallowed him into the hive. I heard him screaming through a wall of chitin.</line>
    <line>We studied them together. He wanted to *understand*. They wanted to *digest*. Now I hunt.</line>
    <line>I admired them too closely. They punished me for it. Curiosity cost me everything.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chitin">
    <line>Harder than steel. Flexible as fear. I kept a fragment once—until it twitched in my hand.</line>
    <line>Their exoskeleton grows with battle. Every scar a promotion, every crack an honor.</line>
    <line>You’ll hear it first—chitin scraping stone. When you do, it’s already too late.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="venom">
    <line>Their venom doesn’t just kill—it silences. Numbs the will before it stops the heart.</line>
    <line>One drop paralyzed a warhorse. I use it in experiments. Carefully. Regretfully.</line>
    <line>The warriors coat their blades in it. The drones, their teeth. Efficiency.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="slay" itemType="KillQuestScroll" ctorArgs="BlackSolenWarrior,12,8500">
    <line>You want to help? Kill them. Twelve warriors. No drones. No sympathy. Just silence.</line>

  <!-- Red Herrings and Flavor -->

  <entry keyword="silence">
    <line>They don’t speak. Not aloud. But somehow, you *know* what they want.</line>
    <line>True silence isn’t absence. It’s pressure. Like they press against your thoughts.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tunnel">
    <line>They move through tunnels like memories through regret—fast and unwanted.</line>
    <line>Don’t chase them into their tunnels. The walls *move*. So do the floors.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>The Solen perform rituals before they molt. It looks like dancing, but isn’t.</line>
    <line>I watched one draw a symbol in the dirt with its legs. Then it shed its skin—and hissed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mandible">
    <line>Mandibles that can shear bone. They hum when they’re close. That’s not fear—it’s resonance.</line>
    <line>The click of mandibles means they’re tasting the air. Or deciding where to strike.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="glow">
    <line>Their eyes don’t glow. Your fear does. The light is you reflecting off them.</line>
    <line>Only the young ones glow. The old? Dark as tunnels. Deadlier still.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="molt">
    <line>They molt in solitude—dig a chamber, seal it shut. When they emerge, they’re sharper. Meaner.</line>
    <line>Found a molted shell once. Still twitching. No wind. No reason. I burned it anyway.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="drone">
    <line>Drones hum to each other when alone. Some say it's communication. I say it’s prayer.</line>
    <line>The drones pretend to be dumb. But I’ve seen them hesitate—*choose* their targets.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eggs">
    <line>The eggs are translucent. You can see the legs curled inside. Sometimes they twitch at sounds.</line>
    <line>I broke an egg once. The smell clung to me for days. So did the guilt.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="acid">
    <line>They spit acid when cornered. Eats through leather. Bone too, if you're unlucky.</line>
    <line>Their acid smells sweet. That’s the warning, oddly enough—if it smells like honey, *run*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="antenna">
    <line>Slice off an antenna and they stagger—like they’ve lost part of their soul.</line>
    <line>The antennae detect vibrations, emotions, blood. They *feel* your intent.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="night">
    <line>They become more active at night. The hive’s heat rises. Something stirs deeper down.</line>
    <line>Midnight is when they chant. No voices. Just the sound of dirt shifting in rhythm.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fungus">
    <line>The hive grows fungus on purpose—lightless, wet, and pulsing. It’s part of their food. And not just theirs.</line>
    <line>The fungus glows sometimes. I used to think it was bioluminescence. Now I think it's watching.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="queen's call">
    <line>The Queen can call them silently. One moment scattered, next they converge—like a thought forming.</line>
    <line>Heard the Queen’s call once. Didn’t recognize my own name for days afterward.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="marks">
    <line>They leave marks in tunnel walls—grooves, patterns, like music carved into stone.</line>
    <line>I thought they were random. Then I found one that matched my old journal sketch.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="skin">
    <line>You can feel it on your skin down there. Not just heat—something crawling, thinking, weighing you.</line>
    <line>Stay long enough in the hive and your skin starts to itch. That’s not just nerves.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="echo">
    <line>Their tunnels echo wrong. Your words come back slower. Sometimes not at all.</line>
    <line>One echo came back in another voice. I never spoke aloud again down there.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="name">
    <line>They don’t have names. But I’ve given them names. Makes it easier to burn them.</line>
    <line>Call them what you like. They don’t answer. They *listen*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="breath">
    <line>You ever try to breathe in the hive? Feels like breathing through velvet soaked in oil.</line>
    <line>My apprentice used to say the air down there has memory. I laughed. I don’t anymore.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="click">
    <line>That clicking—they do it constantly. Communication? Counting? I stopped trying to decode it.</line>
    <line>It gets faster before they strike. Like a heartbeat. Not yours. *Theirs*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>Their blood isn't red. It's cloudy, thick. Clings to your blade like guilt.</line>
    <line>I bottled some once. It's still warm. Still *bubbling*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pattern">
    <line>Their patrols follow strange patterns. Mathematical. Like they're tracing a map only they can see.</line>
    <line>The more I watched them, the more I saw meaning. Then I stopped watching. For sanity's sake.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="language">
    <line>They have no spoken tongue—but the tunnels *speak* if you know how to read them.</line>
    <line>I think they write. Not with ink. With arrangement. With decay. Whole stories told in rot.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nest">
    <line>They don’t sleep in nests. They rest in arrangements. Circles. Spirals. Like rituals.</line>
    <line>I stepped into one once. Took me three hours to find my way back out. Tunnel hadn’t changed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>They bury their dead. Not out of reverence—out of design. Compost becomes culture.</line>
    <line>I saw three warriors circle a dying one. Not mercy. Not mourning. Just... acknowledgment.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dirt">
    <line>The dirt near a hive feels warm. Alive. Like it’s breathing.</line>
    <line>Dirt under their hives is sterile. Nothing grows. Nothing escapes.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="loss">
    <line>I lost more than people. I lost the wonder. Now all I see is the hunger.</line>
    <line>You don’t grieve with tears in the hive. You grieve with fire. And blades.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="obsession">
    <line>They say I’m obsessed. I say they’re blind. What else deserves this much thought?</line>
    <line>Obsession is just clarity sharpened by grief. Ask the hive—I’m sure it understands.</line>

    <line>The hive is alive. It *breathes*—walls throb with heartbeats not your own.</line>

    <line>They cut bone like it's paper. One twitch and you're *hollowed*, not dead—hollowed.</line>
    <line>Mandibles are not weapons. They're *tools*. The queen shapes her brood with them.</line>

    <line>The betrayal was... surgical. Like being removed from your own dream. Awake. Screaming.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="retribution">
    <line>I don’t want justice. I want *extinction*. Let the hive weep in silence.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flaw">
    <line>A gem’s flaw often tells a better story than its polish.</line>

    <line>Under great pressure, even chaos becomes crystal. It’s a comforting metaphor, don’t you think?</line>
    <line>Diamonds envy tourmaline—not for brilliance, but for complexity born of pressure.</line>

    <line>A troll can ruin the scent of a forest for days. I’ve learned to track them by stench alone.</line>
    <line>You smell a mix of mushrooms, rotting meat, and wet wool—you’ve got trolls nearby.</line>

    <line>They hate fire. Burns through that thick hide. Makes 'em panic. Try it next time.</line>

  <entry keyword="cave">
    <line>They love caves—dark, damp, full of echoes. Easy to ambush the unwary.</line>
    <line>A troll cave smells like sweat, fungus, and failure. But that’s where they breed.</line>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>Aim for the eye. Not because it's weak—just because it's satisfying.</line>
    <line>One-eyed troll is still dangerous. But at least it blinks slower.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mud">
    <line>Trolls roll in mud not to clean, but to cool their skin. Filthy logic for filthy beasts.</line>
    <line>Some trolls think mud makes them invisible. It doesn't. Just makes them stink louder.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="teeth">
    <line>Troll teeth don’t fall out—they multiply. I pulled four from a single jaw once.</line>
    <line>A troll’s bite isn’t strong—but those teeth are filthy. Infection’ll kill you faster than the bite.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bridge">
    <line>They love bridges. Maybe they think they own 'em. Maybe they’re just too dumb to cross without stopping.</line>
    <line>Bridges draw trolls like honey draws flies. That’s why I camp by them—with traps.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trap">
    <line>I’ve built traps from rope, meat, and bad luck. Trolls fall for all three.</line>
    <line>A troll will walk into a trap three times. Fourth time? Still walks in. Fifth? That’s the charm.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bones">
    <line>Trolls gnaw bones like dogs, but they stack them like trophies. Like they remember who they ate.</line>
    <line>If you find a pile of bones with bite marks and moss—you're near a troll nest.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="club">
    <line>A troll’s club is usually a tree, or a rock with a handle. Still hurts like an axe.</line>
    <line>Some trolls shape their clubs. Others just rip them out of the ground. Either way, you’ll feel it.</line>

  <entry keyword="stupid">
    <line>Trolls are dumb, but not *stupid*. They know fear, fire, and how to flank a camp.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fungus">
    <line>Trolls grow fungus on their backs. Sometimes they eat it. Sometimes it eats them.</line>
    <line>Fungal patches bloom on troll hides like rot. Druid said one type sings at night. I don’t want to know how he learned that.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="boots">
    <line>You can always tell a troll’s been through—muddy prints, cracked trees, and a smell in your boots.</line>
    <line>My boots are troll-hide. Fought the beast for three days to earn 'em. Still smell like sweat and sorrow.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="armor">
    <line>You won’t see trolls in armor. They grow their own hide thick. Smiths hate ‘em for it.</line>
    <line>Armor’s for those who bleed. Trolls don’t. Not unless you *make* them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grudge">
    <line>I don’t forget troll wounds. Neither do they. Fought one that recognized me—charged like I owed it money.</line>
    <line>Trolls hold grudges. You cut one and run, expect it back next moon. Bigger. Angrier.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="torch">
    <line>Carry a torch in troll lands. Not just for light. It keeps the bold ones back... sometimes.</line>
    <line>A troll saw my torch once and laughed. So I lit its beard. Wasn’t laughing after that.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moss">
    <line>Trolls smear moss on wounds. Doesn’t help, but they believe it does. Dumb healing is still healing.</line>
    <line>If you find green blood and moss stuck to a tree, a troll’s nearby. Or a really lost alchemist.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="snore">
    <line>Their snores carry for miles. One shook my tent from three hills away.</line>
    <line>If a hill’s snoring, don’t climb it. It might climb back.</line>

  <entry keyword="drink">
    <line>I watched a troll drink from a swamp. Then vomit. Then drink again. No taste, no memory.</line>
    <line>Some trolls ferment swamp sludge into something they call ‘booz’. It’s alive. And angry.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="lore">
    <line>Old stories say trolls were cursed giants. I say they’re just bad ideas made flesh.</line>
    <line>Some bards say trolls were once wise. Those bards didn’t meet the one that ate his own foot.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cooking">
    <line>Trolls don’t cook. They warm things by sitting on them. Including people.</line>
    <line>I saw a troll roast a goat once—still wearing the saddle.</line>

    <line>Trolls smell fear. Also bread. Mostly bread. Brings ‘em running.</line>
    <line>Break a troll’s nose, you buy yourself five seconds. That’s all I need.</line>

  <entry keyword="siblings">
    <line>Troll siblings don’t fight. They *compete*. One starts chewing your leg, the other starts on your arm.</line>
    <line>Troll twins are worse. They speak in grunts and finish each other’s smashes.</line>

    <line>Compost is alchemy for plants. But not all compost is equal. The best comes from the peel of purple carrots.</line>

    <line>To brine is to preserve the soul of a turnip. Clove, my friend, is the true awakener.</line>
    <line>Clove gives the turnip its voice. Without it, pickling is but wet storage. Would you hear more?</line>

  <entry keyword="legend">
    <line>Legends say a smith once made a Verite sword so sharp it cut moonbeams.</line>

    <line>Treasure is in the eye of the beholder. Mine just happens to be Verite-shaped.</line>

    <line>Fire is both friend and foe to a smith. It can forge or destroy.</line>

    <line>A cloak lined with Verite chainmail? Only for those with strong shoulders.</line>

    <line>Cloaks are for mystery. Verite is for certainty.</line>

  <entry keyword="map">
    <line>I once followed a treasure map. It led me to a barrel of old boots.</line>

    <line>If you find a map marked ‘X’, pray it leads to Verite and not a kobold nest.</line>

  <entry keyword="kobold">
    <line>Kobolds love shiny things—just like me, but less picky.</line>

    <line>Dwarves know their metals. If a dwarf compliments your Verite, you’ve done well.</line>

    <line>Luck finds those who dig deepest. Or those who read the right books.</line>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>The moon casts a green shadow on Verite. Some say it’s an omen.</line>
    <line>Smiths used to forge under the full moon, hoping for enchanted results.</line>
    <line>Moonlit nights are best for storytelling—or polishing ingots.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="book">
    <line>I keep a journal of every ingot forged. Some are worth reading, some… less so.</line>

    <line>Some claim the right tune can improve smelting results. I hum, just in case.</line>

    <line>The forge is where dreams are shaped in flame. Every Verite ingot I make starts with a single spark.</line>

  <entry keyword="hydration">
    <line>Hydration is the gift of the melon. Over 90% water, yet rich in joy!</line>
    <line>A single bite, and the desert inside you is quenched. But structure is key too, wouldn’t you agree?</line>
    <line>Hydration begins the journey. But beneath the juice lies its structure—the vessel of perfection.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="structure">
    <line>The rind, the flesh, the seeds—each part has purpose. Shall we speak of the rind?</line>
    <line>Structure! That firm green rind guards the treasure within. Let’s speak of it.</line>
    <line>Structure is the silent strength of a watermelon. The rind, especially, has stories to tell.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rind">
    <line>The rind protects, yet even it can be pickled! Ever tried rind stew? No? Then you’re missing out.</line>
    <line>Pickled rind is an acquired taste, but I relish it. However, the flesh—now that’s where the artistry lies.</line>
    <line>The rind is armor. The flesh is song. Shall we talk about the flesh next?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flesh">
    <line>So red, so juicy—like biting into a summer breeze. But beware the seeds hidden within.</line>
    <line>The flesh gives joy, but the seeds remind us to savor. Let’s discuss them.</line>
    <line>Flesh may delight, but seeds carry the legacy of the melon. Care to explore that truth?</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="seeds">
    <line>Seeds—dark pearls of potential! Some spit them, some save them. A matter of discipline.</line>

    <line>Seasons shape sweetness. Never trust a melon grown out of time.</line>

    <line>Green—the promise of freshness. Or envy, depending on the context.</line>
    <line>Green like the rind, green like youth. But neither lasts forever.</line>

  <entry keyword="red">
    <line>Red is the heartbeat of a watermelon. But too red? That’s a trick of over-ripeness.</line>
    <line>Red draws the eye, but the wise test firmness before committing their bite.</line>

  <entry keyword="sugar">
    <line>Some sprinkle sugar on watermelon. I say: sacrilege!</line>
    <line>Sugar enhances sweetness, but hides flaws. A pure melon needs no help.</line>

  <entry keyword="salt">
    <line>Salt on watermelon? It’s... controversial. But surprisingly delightful.</line>
    <line>Salt brings contrast. Some say it makes the sweetness sharper. Others say it’s madness.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>Last night, I dreamed of a melon the size of a house. When I cut it open, it was... empty.</line>
    <line>Dreams of watermelon often mean you're thirsty. Or haunted by fruit-based regret.</line>

  <entry keyword="festival">
    <line>Our village holds a melon festival every year. Someone always ends up covered in juice.</line>
    <line>Melon carving, seed-spitting, rind racing—it’s chaos, but joyful chaos.</line>

  <entry keyword="science">
    <line>Science explains the sweetness curve and cell structure. But not the soul of the melon.</line>
    <line>They measure sugar content now. Brix score. I prefer instinct and a solid knock.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="knock">
    <line>You can tell a ripe one by the sound. A low, hollow thump—like an ancient drum.</line>

    <line>He followed their lights. Said they promised secrets. All they gave was madness wrapped in mystery.</line>
    <line>His name was Calen. Bright boy. Brighter than me. Now he glows in the dark, somewhere in the Swamp of Silence.</line>
    <line>He used to laugh at me. Now I hear him laughing in wisp-song. I hate that laugh.</line>

    <line>Years I watched them. Sketched their runes. Recorded their flickers. They change, you know. They *adapt*.</line>
    <line>Their light pulses with intent. Not random. A code, perhaps. Or laughter.</line>
    <line>I once caged one. It sang until I wept. Then it vanished. The cage remains—empty, but humming.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="whisper">
    <line>They whisper in old tongues—echoes of truths not meant for ears.</line>
    <line>A wisp’s whisper is like a needle in the brain. Sharp. Quiet. Permanent.</line>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Wisps won’t pass a mirror. Not because they fear reflection—but because they see too *much* in it.</line>

    <line>The Swamp of Silence. Where the light is wrong and the air forgets your name.</line>
    <line>DarkWisps breed there. Feed on echoes. It’s always damp, and never rains.</line>

    <line>Dreams become windows. Sometimes doors. Wisps slip through. Not all return the same.</line>

  <entry keyword="eyes">
    <line>They have no eyes, yet they *see*. They judged me once. I felt it.</line>
    <line>Wisps don’t blink. They don’t need to. We blink, and they’re gone.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="void">
    <line>They come from the void, not space. Space has stars. The void has memory.</line>
    <line>Stare into the void and you’ll find them staring back—if you’re lucky.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ink">
    <line>Wisp thoughts look like ink underwater—blots and trails. I tried writing one down. The page bled.</line>

    <line>The song never ends. You just stop being able to notice it.</line>

    <line>They flicker when they lie. Or when they think you're interesting.</line>
    <line>Flicker faster, they get agitated. Flicker slower, they’re luring you in.</line>

    <line>The spindle waits, the loom is bare! Fetch me 30 wool bundles, and take this scroll. May your path be soft and strong.</line>

    <line>Crochet—faster, some say. But I say: it’s not the tool, it's the touch. Do you dye your yarn?</line>

  <entry keyword="loom">
    <line>The loom is a metaphor for life: threads cross, patterns form, and snags must be repaired.</line>
    <line>Some say the gods themselves wove the first loom from starlight. I find mine in the attic, next to the jam jars.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="yarn">
    <line>Yarn can tangle friendships as easily as it tangles in a cat’s paw.</line>

    <line>A scarf is like a friendship: warm, winding, and occasionally full of holes.</line>

  <entry keyword="spindle">
    <line>Careful with spindles. One pricked finger, and you’re dreaming for a hundred years.</line>
    <line>The spindle’s spin mimics the world itself—constant, dizzying, meaningful.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="itchy">
    <line>Some say wool is itchy. I say: you’ve never met a sheep with taste.</line>
    <line>If wool itches, perhaps it’s the fabric rejecting *you*.</line>

  <entry keyword="shears">
    <line>Shears are poetry in sharpness. You must respect the blade, even in the barn.</line>
    <line>A good shearer can clip a sheep in two minutes flat. I take three days and apologize the whole time.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="patterns">
    <line>Patterns emerge in wool, life, and arguments at dinner. It's best to recognize them early.</line>
    <line>I once knitted an accidental map of Britannia into a sweater. Now it's lost and oddly accurate.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="laundry">
    <line>Washing wool is a gentle affair. Too much heat and you’re crafting doll clothes.</line>
    <line>Never trust a mage who can’t properly launder wool. It says everything about their priorities.</line>

  <entry keyword="rain">
    <line>Rain makes the fields lush and the wool damp. A cruel duality.</line>
    <line>I love the smell of wet wool. It smells like home. Or possibly mildew.</line>

  <entry keyword="thimble">
    <line>Thimbles: humble, protective, underappreciated. Like grandmothers.</line>

  <entry keyword="moth">
    <line>Moths—the ancient enemy. I've declared war more times than I can count.</line>

    <line>Lace is the contradiction of strength in fragility. Like a battlecry made from cobwebs.</line>

  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>I am a scholar of dragons—chronicler, admirer, and… executioner, when duty calls.</line>
    <line>I study dragons. Their lore, their breath, their bones. Especially those that outlive their purpose.</line>
    <line>I knew dragons once. Wrote poems about them. Now I write death records.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dragon">
    <line>Dragons are majesty incarnate—flame and wisdom wrapped in wing and fang.</line>
    <line>To understand a dragon is to understand the fear of kings and the pride of gods.</line>
    <line>There are dragons... and then there are wyrms. The difference is more than age—it's rot of the soul.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ancient wyrm">
    <line>Ancient Wyrms are corrupted relics—dragons twisted by their greed and arrogance.</line>
    <line>They’ve outlived honor and feasted on the memory of nobler kin. That’s not age—that’s decay.</line>
    <line>The longer they live, the more they forget. Even their names crumble to ash. What remains is hunger.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hatred">
    <line>My hatred was earned. An Ancient Wyrm reduced my mentor to cinders during a communion rite.</line>
    <line>I watched one consume an entire grove—trees, birds, druids, and dreams. All gone.</line>
    <line>Hate is too simple. I *understand* them. That’s why I must *end* them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hoard">
    <line>The hoard is their sickness. Gold is memory to them. They don’t remember faces—only coins.</line>
    <line>They sleep atop kingdoms worth of wealth, dreaming of ages that never loved them.</line>
    <line>If you find melted crowns and shattered gems, you’re near a wyrm’s nest.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="weakness">
    <line>Fire? No. Blade? Rarely. The key is timing. Strike during their breath's recoil. Few live long enough to learn that.</line>
    <line>Their pride is their weakness. They *will* pause to gloat. That’s your opening.</line>
    <line>Find the softest scale beneath the wing. If it blinks, stab it.</line>

  <entry keyword="end" itemType="KillQuestScroll" ctorArgs="AncientWyrm,1,20000">
    <line>You would bring an end to one? Then take this scroll. Let death find the deathless.</line>
    <line>If you seek justice or glory, you’ll find both by slaying an Ancient Wyrm. I’ll know when it dies.</line>
    <line>Words are wind until scaled beasts fall. Here—take this. Return only when the wyrm’s heart ceases.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Optional Red Herrings & Depth -->

  <entry keyword="scale">
    <line>Their scales tell their age—some shimmer like stars, others are blackened with sins.</line>
    <line>A collector once tried to skin a wyrm. They found him inside a molten suit of armor.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="breath">
    <line>It’s not just fire. It’s memory, rage, and time burned into air.</line>
    <line>Their breath scorches the soul. I saw a paladin weep after merely inhaling it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sky">
    <line>Wyrms rarely fly anymore. Wings too ancient, or perhaps they no longer *need* to rise.</line>
    <line>When they take to the sky, something always burns beneath.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="voice">
    <line>The wyrm’s voice is a thunder not heard, but *felt*. Inside your bones.</line>
    <line>I heard one speak once. The ground around us cracked open in despair.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="eye">
    <line>Look into a wyrm’s eye and see yourself aged, broken, and already ash.</line>
    <line>One glance from them and knights forget their names.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mentor">
    <line>She was brilliant—spoke Old Draconic like song. One ritual, one mistake, one breath... gone.</line>
    <line>My mentor thought she could reason with the wyrm. Turns out, hunger doesn't negotiate.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="flame">
    <line>Their fire doesn’t spread. It *erupts*. Nothing grows in wyrm-fire’s wake.</line>
    <line>They burn not to kill—but to *erase*.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bones">
    <line>Wyrm bones pulse with old magic. Touch one wrong and it remembers who it belonged to.</line>
    <line>A necromancer once tried to raise a wyrm’s skeleton. We buried what was left in seven urns.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="name">
    <line>I no longer speak its name. Names have power—and that one draws embers.</line>
    <line>The wyrm’s true name? Lost. Forgotten by even the stars.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ashes">
    <line>Ashes are all that remain when you lose an argument with an Ancient Wyrm.</line>
    <line>Some ashes carry whispers. I've kept a jar that still hums on cold nights.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="talon">
    <line>Wyrm talons don’t just pierce—they *unmake*. I saw one tear through a keep like parchment.</line>
    <line>A single talon, mounted in a cathedral, still bleeds smoke on stormy nights.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dream">
    <line>I dreamed of dragons before I ever saw one. The wyrm turned that dream into a funeral.</line>
    <line>They say some wyrms sleep for centuries… and when they wake, they burn what they dreamed about.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sleep">
    <line>They sleep buried beneath old mountains. You can hear them snore if you press your ear to the stone.</line>
    <line>Their dreams are worse than their waking wrath. I read a journal once. Just once.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="library">
    <line>I found tomes bound in wyrmhide. Blasphemous? Perhaps. But they survived three wars.</line>
    <line>Books on dragons are rare. Books *by* dragons? Rarer—and deeply unsettling.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="riddle">
    <line>Wyrms used to speak in riddles. Now they just roar. Simpler, I suppose.</line>
    <line>One asked me a riddle once. Got it wrong. Lost my left eyebrow and two companions.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mirror">
    <line>Never show a wyrm its reflection. They remember what they’ve become—and *hate* it.</line>
    <line>Mirrors crack around their presence. Something about truth not being welcome.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="stone">
    <line>Wyrms don’t collect gems for value—they remember who gave them. That’s why they keep them close.</line>
    <line>Dragonstone isn’t a gem. It’s bone, petrified by pressure and time. Makes fine armor. Cursed, though.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chant">
    <line>The old draconic chants aren’t spells—they’re *apologies*. We recite them to keep our skin.</line>
    <line>I chant when I enter dragon ruins. Not for protection—for respect. And maybe fear.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>Their shadow passes overhead, and crops wither. Coincidences… at first.</line>
    <line>A wyrm’s shadow once stretched across three valleys. It still hasn't left the trees.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blood">
    <line>Their blood doesn’t clot. It boils. Spill enough and the ground remembers.</line>
    <line>One drop of wyrm blood turned a pond into steam. And a fisherman into legend.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tail">
    <line>The tail is underestimated. I've seen one flatten a cavalry charge without turning its head.</line>
    <line>There’s a rhythm to the way they move it. A dance. A warning.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fear">
    <line>I don’t fear them anymore. Fear is too small a word. I *respect* their ending.</line>
    <line>Real fear is knowing you're in a wyrm’s story now. And it doesn’t end with you winning.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>We tried a ritual once—to commune, not to command. It ended in fire and silence.</line>
    <line>Rituals involving wyrms rarely go as planned. Mostly because wyrms weren’t invited.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wind">
    <line>The air changes when a wyrm nears—thickens, like it's holding its breath.</line>
    <line>Even the wind flees their wings. It whistles a warning if you know how to hear it.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="grave">
    <line>You can’t bury a wyrm. The land won’t accept the body. It just… smolders.</line>
    <line>I stood atop a wyrm’s grave once. Felt like the mountain sighed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tongue">
    <line>They taste with their tongues—and speak in syllables that make bones ache.</line>
    <line>A wyrm once licked a mage clean off a tower. That’s not metaphor. That’s trauma.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="skyfire">
    <line>Skyfire—that’s what we call it when three wyrms fight. Towns vanish beneath it.</line>
    <line>Only fools and poets stay to watch skyfire. I used to be both.</line>

  <entry keyword="purge" itemType="KillQuestScroll" ctorArgs="AncientWyrm,1,20000">
    <line>Yes. A purge. An ending long overdue. Take this scroll and become justice writ in ash.</line>

    <line>My library was my life: rare tomes, ancient scrolls, wisdom gleaned from decades. All consumed in one night by a pit fiend’s wrath.</line>
    <line>I watched helpless as flame erased centuries of knowledge. The pit fiend left only cinders—and me, swearing vengeance.</line>

    <line>My greatest humiliation involved a stolen honey jar, a swarm of angry bees, and far too many witnesses.</line>

    <line>I lost my reputation, my favorite hat, and my place at the academy, all in one sticky afternoon.</line>

  <!-- STEP 1 -->
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>What do I do? I am a scholar and a sworn adversary of the Plague Beasts.</line>
    <line>I study their biology, their habits—and their cruelties. Some call me obsessed. I call it necessary.</line>

  </entry>

  <!-- STEP 2 -->
  <entry keyword="plaguebeast">
    <line>Plague Beasts are walking nightmares. Their flesh festers with toxins, their steps rot the very earth.</line>
    <line>They are nature’s mistake, stitched together from disease and hunger. I track their migrations, and their victims.</line>
    <line>Most fear their bite. Fools fear only the obvious. Their true danger is in their toxin. Ask me about it, if you dare.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- STEP 3 -->
  <entry keyword="toxin">
    <line>Their toxin seeps from every pore, every wound. It corrupts the soil, blights the air.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen plants wither from a single drop. The unlucky become victims—ask me about victims, if you wish to understand my hatred.</line>
    <line>Even the strongest warriors fall. You’ll find the truth in their victims. Ask about them.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- STEP 4 -->
  <entry keyword="victim">
    <line>I lost more than study subjects to the Plague Beasts. My companion, the loyal hound Briar, perished to their toxin.</line>
    <line>I’ve buried friends, neighbors, even kin, all lost to that abomination’s rot. Some say it’s fate. I say it’s murder.</line>
    <line>If only I’d found the remedy sooner... Ah, yes. The remedy. Ask me about it, and you’ll see the depths of my regret.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- STEP 5 -->
  <entry keyword="remedy">
    <line>The remedy is rare—hard-won from bitter root and silverleaf. It soothes the flesh, but not the soul.</line>

    <line>Yes, vengeance. The only cure left. Ask me, if you wish to share my crusade.</line>

  <entry keyword="dog">
    <line>Briar was the bravest hound—never flinched from a beast twice his size. He deserved a better end.</line>
    <line>They say dogs can smell evil. Briar never barked—he just stared and growled when plague was near.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rot">
    <line>The scent of rot clings to Plague Beasts like a cloak. If you smell decay, flee—unless you’re hunting.</line>
    <line>I once found a patch of earth that would never bloom again, all thanks to their rot.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mutation">
    <line>No two Plague Beasts are the same. Tumors, twisted limbs, extra eyes—I catalog them all. Disgusting work.</line>
    <line>Some whisper that they’re born from magical accidents. I think it’s the world’s way of reminding us of chaos.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="blight">
    <line>Blight follows them like a shadow. Crops fail, trees blacken. Even stone cracks at their passing, or so it seems.</line>
    <line>Every year, the blight grows. My notes grow with it, page after page of sorrow.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ooze">
    <line>Ooze drips from their wounds, hissing where it falls. I’ve bottled it, but never found a use—unless you count nightmares.</line>
    <line>Once, a drop of ooze burned through my glove. I still bear the mark.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="swamp">
    <line>Swamps hide many horrors, but none more persistent than the Plague Beast. It is their throne room, their nursery.</line>
    <line>I mapped a swamp once—came back with more questions and a rash that never healed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fungus">
    <line>Fungus sprouts in their footprints. Some glows green, some screams when burned. None are edible—trust me.</line>
    <line>I once mistook a rare mushroom for a cure. Instead, it made the sickness worse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="breath">
    <line>Their breath is foul enough to curl iron. If you’re downwind, count yourself unlucky.</line>

    <line>The scream of a Plague Beast chills the soul. Some say it’s the last echo of all they’ve devoured.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nest">
    <line>They build nests from bones, mud, and rotten cloth. I’ve found them in old barns and abandoned crypts.</line>
    <line>If you stumble into a nest, walk backwards—slowly, silently. Then run.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="stinger">
    <line>Some Plague Beasts wield stingers like scorpions. I keep a jar of them—curiosity, not pride.</line>
    <line>If you see a stinger, keep your distance. The toxin there is the deadliest of all.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="legend">
    <line>Legends say Plague Beasts once served a mad king. If so, his kingdom must have reeked of death.</line>
    <line>Some legends are cautionary. With Plague Beasts, even legends aren’t enough warning.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>Some nights, the Plague Beasts howl at the moon. I’ve charted their cycles—never found a pattern.</line>
    <line>On full moons, their activity increases. Or perhaps that’s just my sleeplessness talking.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="alchemist">
    <line>I’ve traded notes with alchemists, all seeking a cure. None have succeeded—yet.</line>
    <line>Alchemists promise much. Plague Beasts deliver only suffering.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scar">
    <line>I wear my scars as warnings to others: beware the things that fester in darkness.</line>
    <line>Every scar is a lesson. Most hurt, some itch, all remind me why I fight.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mire">
    <line>There’s no clean way through a mire, only paths of least regret. Plague Beasts thrive where others sink.</line>
    <line>If you find yourself lost in a mire, pray it’s only the mud that slows you.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="harvest">
    <line>Farmers dread the harvest if Plague Beasts roam—the grain withers, and so does hope.</line>
    <line>I once helped with a harvest after a plague. All we gathered were dead stalks.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="talon">
    <line>Their talons can shred armor like parchment. I keep a few as morbid souvenirs.</line>
    <line>Each talon bears a unique twist—like a signature, or a curse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="witch">
    <line>Witches avoid Plague Beasts, or so they claim. I suspect even magic finds them distasteful.</line>
    <line>One witch told me she could cure their poison. She vanished that night.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cloak">
    <line>I wear a cloak of oiled leather—it repels the worst of their spittle, but not the smell.</line>
    <line>A good cloak is a scholar’s shield. Better if it covers your nose.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="wound">
    <line>A wound from a Plague Beast festers fast. If you’re bitten, run for help—and pray.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen wounds that weep green. No bandage holds back that corruption for long.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>They linger in shadows, moving only when least expected. I trust only fire to keep them at bay.</line>
    <line>Every shadow might hide a Plague Beast. It’s the price of vigilance—and paranoia.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="curse">
    <line>Some say Plague Beasts are curses given form. If so, who cursed us? And how do we lift it?</line>
    <line>I’ve tried to break their curse with words, with charms, with steel. Only steel ever worked.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="herb">
    <line>I collect herbs to ward off sickness, but nothing wards off a Plague Beast except sharp steel.</line>
    <line>Silverleaf is said to purify tainted wounds, but it’s rare—and not always enough.</line>

  <entry keyword="plaquerat">
    <line>PlagueRats are vermin touched by misery itself—fur streaked with soot, eyes fever-bright.</line>

  <entry keyword="friend">
    <line>He was a ferret, nimble and bold, my truest companion in the hunt against the rats.</line>
    <line>Swiftpaw—quick of mind and gentle of heart. He never lost a battle—until the PlagueRats found him.</line>
    <line>I watched helpless as fever claimed him. He was more than a pet—he was hope itself. Ask me about Swiftpaw if you wish to hear more.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="swiftpaw">
    <line>Swiftpaw never feared the dark or the crawling masses. He chased them through every tunnel and gutter.</line>
    <line>He saved me thrice from the teeth of the PlagueRats. In the end, it was not their teeth, but their disease that slew him.</line>
    <line>I swore revenge for Swiftpaw. Ask me about disease, if you dare.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="disease">
    <line>Disease is the PlagueRat’s greatest weapon. Their bite brings fever, their fleas carry rot.</line>
    <line>I study their symptoms, hoping for a cure—yet each experiment brings only sorrow.</line>
    <line>If you wish to fight PlagueRats, you must understand where their disease breeds. Ask me about their nests.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="nest">
    <line>Their nests are cesspits—piles of rags, bones, and rotting things hidden in the darkest cellars.</line>

    <line>Raiju rarely appear without rain. It hides them, nourishes them, makes them bold.</line>
    <line>I find rain soothing—unless I see a spark in the downpour.</line>

  <entry keyword="music">
    <line>Some say Raiju can be calmed by music. Others say it angers them. I won’t risk it.</line>

    <line>Raiju claws slice through steel like paper. I keep one as a reminder—handle with care.</line>

  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="map">
    <line>I’ve drawn hundreds of maps of Raiju sightings. Each storm changes their territory.</line>

  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="lantern">
    <line>Lantern light draws insects—and, some say, Raiju. I’ve never seen proof, but I keep mine shuttered during storms.</line>
    <line>Once, a lantern exploded in a storm. Was it Raiju mischief? Perhaps.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="monsoon">
    <line>The monsoon brings more Raiju than any other season. I call it the Festival of Thunder.</line>

    <line>Raiju are said to sleep inside hollow bamboo during calm days. I’ve split dozens—found only ants and splinters.</line>
    <line>Bamboo forests hum with energy after a storm. Is it Raiju magic? No one knows.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="statue">
    <line>Temple courtyards have statues of Raiju to ward off lesser spirits. I doubt they impress the real thing.</line>
    <line>I built a tiny Raiju statue for luck. It melted in the first lightning strike.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="fisherman">
    <line>Fishermen say Raiju tangle their nets and summon storms. Maybe they’re just unlucky.</line>

  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="egg">
    <line>Rumors say Raiju lay eggs in clouds. Imagine hunting a thunder-egg—what would hatch?</line>
    <line>I’ve searched for Raiju eggs for years. All I’ve found are hailstones and disappointment.</line>
  </entry>
  
  <entry keyword="drum">
    <line>Some villages beat drums to frighten away Raiju. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it only brings more thunder.</line>
    <line>I made my own drum. The Raiju ignored it—and so did everyone else.</line>

    <line>Eggs—my life’s work. I once kept a collection spanning every bird from finch to roc.</line>

  <entry keyword="loss">
    <line>I guarded those eggs like treasure. The raptors knew. One night, they struck.</line>
    <line>Loss is too small a word. They shattered my hope, my legacy—devoured every specimen.</line>
    <line>To understand my enmity, ask about vengeance.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vengeance">
    <line>Vengeance is a dangerous companion. For years I hunted them, mapped their nests, learned their calls.</line>
    <line>I thought to frighten them away, but raptors are not easily cowed. Now, only action remains.</line>
    <line>If you share my thirst for justice, ask about the hunt.</line>

    <line>Raptors are creatures of shadow—never where you expect, always overhead.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="meat">
    <line>Fresh meat draws raptors from miles. I once baited a trap with lamb—caught nothing but trouble.</line>
    <line>Leave no scraps behind. Raptors will follow the scent, and so will worse.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="trap">
    <line>I designed elaborate traps—nets, spikes, cages. The raptors outsmarted every one.</line>
    <line>If you wish to trap a raptor, bring wit—and luck by the barrel.</line>

    <line>Learn their call, and you learn to fear the silence that follows.</line>

  <entry keyword="cliff">
    <line>Cliffs are raptor territory. Few dare to climb, fewer return whole.</line>
    <line>Once I spent a week on a cliff ledge, studying a nest. Hunger made me reconsider my life choices.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="dawn">
    <line>Dawn is when raptors feast. Best to be indoors when the sun is low.</line>

  <entry keyword="violin">
    <line>It was a family treasure, carved by my ancestor’s hand—destroyed by gnawing teeth in the night.</line>

    <line>Resin draws them like moths to flame. To a rat, the scent is irresistible, more tempting than cheese.</line>

    <line>Some folk try to tame a Boura. I hope their healers are well paid.</line>
    <line>Pets should be small, friendly, and unlikely to flatten your cottage. Boura are none of these.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="garden">
    <line>I once had a garden. Boura had other plans for it. Now I grow stones—they survive best.</line>

  <entry keyword="egg">
    <line>Boura don’t lay eggs—thank the stars. Imagine a clutch of them hatching at once!</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="feast">
    <line>Boura feast on anything green. Your crops, your hat, even your journal if left outside.</line>

  <entry keyword="mud">
    <line>Boura love mud almost as much as fresh grass. My boots are never clean these days.</line>

  <entry keyword="lowland">
    <line>Lowland Boura are more docile, but even they will trample your shoes if you leave them out.</line>
    <line>If you must study Boura, start with the Lowland. They’re less likely to ruin your week.</line>

  <entry keyword="fierce">
    <line>Fierce Boura are a challenge for any tamer. Approach with caution, and good luck.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="chew">
    <line>If it fits in a Boura’s mouth, it’s fair game. Fences, tools, your map—chewed to bits.</line>
    <line>I once lost an entire tent to a chewing Boura. Only the poles remained.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="milk">
    <line>Boura milk is said to have healing properties. I tried it—now I have questions about my sanity.</line>
    <line>They say Boura milk makes strong bones. The taste? Indescribable, and not in a good way.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="song">
    <line>When Boura bellow, it’s hardly a song. More like a challenge to every window in town.</line>
    <line>I tried to mimic their calls once. The resulting stampede was… memorable.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="saddle">
    <line>Some fool tried to saddle a Boura. The fool now makes a living selling splints and bandages.</line>
    <line>Boura don’t take kindly to saddles. Or riders. Or most people, really.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tamer">
    <line>I respect tamers, truly. But even the best have met their match with a stubborn Boura.</line>
    <line>A wise tamer knows when to let the Boura win.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hoofprint">
    <line>Boura hoofprints are everywhere—sometimes I think they spell out insults.</line>
    <line>One day, I’ll pave my yard in iron, just to keep their prints off my doorstep.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="snort">
    <line>The snort of a Boura is a warning—heed it, or prepare for a quick lesson in regret.</line>
    <line>I can hear them snort in my nightmares. It’s always followed by the sound of something breaking.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hide">
    <line>Boura hides are prized by craftsmen, if you can get one without being flattened.</line>
    <line>I’ve heard rumors of enchanted Boura hides, but I value my limbs too much to chase them.</line>

  <entry keyword="fang">
    <line>Those fangs—nature’s scythes. A sabertoothed’s pride, its weapon, and sometimes its doom.</line>

  </entry>
  <entry keyword="solitude">

    <line>My profession? I am the leading authority on the Savage Shamans—if one can call it a profession, rather than a curse.</line>
    <line>I study their rituals, their customs, and their misdeeds. My expertise is hard-won and bitter.</line>
    <line>If you truly wish to understand, ask me about the shamans. But prepare yourself.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shaman">
    <line>Savage Shamans are the wild priests of the forests—masters of blood magic and bitter enemies of civilization.</line>
    <line>They are cunning, elusive, and far more dangerous than their savage kin. Their rituals are the root of much misery.</line>
    <line>If you wish to know why I dedicate my life to studying them, ask about their rituals.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="ritual">
    <line>Their rituals are grisly affairs—bones, blood, and chants that make your skin crawl. But one stands out among them.</line>
    <line>The worst is the so-called Rite of Exile. I was its victim once, and survived by luck alone.</line>
    <line>Ask me about exile, and I’ll tell you how it feels to be hunted by shamans.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="exile">
    <line>Exile is their punishment for outsiders, and their test of strength. They bind you, blindfolded, and leave you for the spirits—or the wolves.</line>
    <line>I wandered for days, haunted by their laughter and the bite of every insect in the swamp.</line>
    <line>What kept me alive? Only hatred—and a strange fascination. Ask about their magic, if you dare.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="magic">
    <line>Their magic is older than the stones. They conjure storms, summon snakes, and twist minds. I have scars from their curses.</line>
    <line>But their greatest secret is their staff. Each shaman crafts one, carved with vile runes.</line>
    <line>If you want to truly harm them, ask me about the staff.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="staff">
    <line>The staff is both weapon and symbol. Break a shaman’s staff, and you break their power. Slay the shaman, and you break the cycle of suffering.</line>
    <line>If you would help me—help the world—ask how you might defeat them.</line>
    <line>Say ‘defeat’, and I will entrust you with a quest worthy of legend.</line>

    <line>Their tattoos tell stories—victories, losses, and the names of spirits. Each one a chapter in pain.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="curse">
    <line>Curse a shaman, and you’ll likely find your luck rotting at the roots.</line>
    <line>They curse with words, with gestures, and sometimes just a glance. I carry several, I suspect.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="moon">
    <line>The full moon draws the shamans from hiding. Their rituals grow wild under its gaze.</line>
    <line>I avoid the woods when the moon is bright. Better to stay home and bar the door.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bone">
    <line>Shamans wear bones in their hair, their cloaks, their jewelry. Every one a warning, or a trophy.</line>
    <line>I once found a necklace of mouse bones. It hummed when I touched it.</line>
  </entry>

    <line>Shamans keep snakes as pets, guardians, or sources of venom. I hate snakes even more than shamans.</line>

    <line>I tried to replicate the paint once. It stained my hands for a month.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cave">
    <line>Shamans favor caves for their ceremonies—dark, damp, echoing with old prayers.</line>
    <line>If you hear chanting from a cave, turn back. Nothing good waits within.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="totem">
    <line>Each shaman carves a totem—owl, snake, bear. Break one, and you’ll earn a curse for your trouble.</line>
    <line>Totems mark territory. I have a collection, but none dare display them openly.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="vision">
    <line>Visions haunt the shaman’s sleep and waking. Sometimes, I think they envy those of us who dream in peace.</line>
    <line>I once drank their dream tea—three days lost to nightmares and shadows.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="enemy">
    <line>To the shamans, everyone is a potential enemy—or a future sacrifice.</line>
    <line>Enemies are remembered in ritual, never forgiven, never forgotten.</line>

    <line>They wear talons on cords—gifts from birds, or trophies from enemies. Each one has meaning.</line>
    <line>A shaman once threatened me with a talon to the eye. I took the hint.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="rain">
    <line>Shamans call rain for crops, or storms for war. Their rituals twist the weather.</line>
    <line>I’ve seen them dance in the downpour, faces painted with lightning and mud.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="fang">
    <line>Fangs hang from their necklaces—wolf, bear, or something stranger. I don’t ask.</line>
    <line>Once, a shaman offered me a fang for luck. I declined.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mark">
    <line>To be marked by a shaman is to carry a burden, or a target. I am marked still, though I hide it.</line>

  <!-- Step 1: Job -->
  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>What do I do? I watch the waves, measure the tides, and document the rise and ruin of the sea’s great serpents.</line>
    <line>Some call me obsessed. I call myself a scholar—others whisper sea-mad. Ask me of serpents, if you wish to learn fear.</line>
    <line>I’ve charted every coil and ripple. If the sea stirs, it’s a serpent’s doing. Ask me about serpents.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Step 2: Serpent -->
  <entry keyword="serpent">
    <line>The sea serpent is elegance and terror combined. A living myth—beautiful from afar, monstrous up close.</line>
    <line>They glide like shadows beneath the moon. Sailors call them legends; I know better. Ask me of sea serpents, if you truly dare.</line>
    <line>To know a serpent, you must respect its cunning. Ask about the sea serpent—they’re unlike any other beast.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Step 3: Sea Serpent -->
  <entry keyword="sea serpent">
    <line>Sea serpents are the architects of shipwrecks, the bane of fishermen, the thieves of treasures and sleep alike.</line>
    <line>My whole life’s work ruined—wrecked by a single emerald-eyed monster. If you’re curious, ask me about the wreck.</line>
    <line>Some hunt them for scales, others for glory. I hunt them for revenge. Ask about the wreck if you wish to know why.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Step 4: Wreck -->
  <entry keyword="wreck">
    <line>Years ago, I captained the Starling. She was my pride—swift, sturdy, and laden with promise. All lost in a storm of scales.</line>
    <line>The serpent rose from the deep, coiled around the Starling, and dragged her into the black. My crew, my cargo—gone.</line>
    <line>I washed ashore clutching nothing but a broken compass. Ask me of that compass, if you seek the heart of my hatred.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Step 5: Compass -->
  <entry keyword="compass">
    <line>It was my father’s compass, passed down through storms and calm. The serpent shattered it—splintered hope and heritage alike.</line>
    <line>I keep a fragment as a reminder, cold as the serpent’s stare. My quest is all that’s left. If you’re willing, ask about vengeance.</line>
    <line>Vengeance guides me now, not the compass. Will you share the hunt? Ask about vengeance, and I’ll tell you how.</line>
  </entry>

  <!-- Step 6: Vengeance -->
  <entry keyword="vengeance">
    <line>The only justice is to slay those emerald-eyed monsters. Will you help me end their reign? Say ‘hunt’ if you have the courage.</line>
    <line>I want their teeth as trophies, their reign of terror ended. Say ‘hunt’ if you’ll face them for me.</line>
    <line>The sea serpent haunts my nights. End it, and you’ll have my thanks. Speak ‘hunt’ to accept this burden.</line>

    <line>An anchor’s supposed to keep you safe. Sometimes it drags you into the deep instead.</line>

    <line>I chronicle the comings and goings of spiders—SentinelSpiders, most of all. My task is thankless, but vital.</line>
    <line>People call me obsessed, but only I know the true threat SentinelSpiders pose. Ask me about spiders if you’re curious—or brave.</line>
    <line>I study their webs, their venom, their silent sentry duty. The SentinelSpider is my nemesis and my muse. Speak the word ‘spider’ if you dare.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="spider">
    <line>Most fear spiders for their fangs, but the SentinelSpider is different: it watches, waits, remembers.</line>
    <line>Spiders are misunderstood. The SentinelSpider is *unforgivable*. Its gaze lingers long after you’ve left. Curious about SentinelSpiders?</line>
    <line>I have studied every leg, every thread. None haunt my dreams like the SentinelSpider. Say ‘SentinelSpider’ if you wish to hear my tale.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="sentinelspider">
    <line>The SentinelSpider is not content to hide in shadows—it *guards* them, and all who wander too close.</line>
    <line>Its name is no accident. They stand watch over ruins, as if the stones themselves are precious. Do you know their habits?</line>
    <line>The SentinelSpider drove me from my own home. Ask me about their habits if you wish to understand why.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="habit">
    <line>SentinelSpiders weave their webs in forgotten places—crypts, cellars, sacred shrines. They do not hunt for food, but for trespassers.</line>
    <line>They are clever, patient, almost...strategic. They can remember your scent for months. Their favorite lair? The old bell tower. Ask me about the bell tower.</line>
    <line>I mapped their routes. They always return to the bell tower—my bell tower. Ask about it, if you’re not faint of heart.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bell tower">
    <line>Once, I lived in that bell tower. Its heights were my retreat—until the SentinelSpider arrived, and cast me out.</line>
    <line>The bells are silent now, wrapped in webs. My notes, my books, all lost to their silken siege. My reason for hatred? The SentinelSpider stole my sanctuary. Ask about vengeance.</line>
    <line>Vengeance? Perhaps. Justice, certainly. The bell tower’s song will not return until the spiders are gone. Ask about vengeance if you wish to help.</line>

    <line>The full moon brings the SentinelSpiders out to hunt. I lock my doors at dusk.</line>

    <line>The poisoners in the shadows, the whisperers of death—ask about assassins, if you truly dare.</line>

    <line>Serpents have always haunted our lands, but the SerpentsFang breed is different—more cunning, more cruel.</line>
    <line>I’ve learned to read the slither in the grass, the scales in the moonlight. Ask about fangs, if you’re not squeamish.</line>
    <line>To understand a serpent, you must know its venom and its mind. The assassins carry both.</line>

    <line>Fangs glisten with more than poison—they hold secrets, if you’re willing to bleed for them.</line>

    <line>Their venom isn’t just deadly—it lingers, warping the mind, twisting dreams into nightmares.</line>

    <line>When the poison takes hold, dreams turn to nightmares—visions of snakes in the walls, whispers in the dark.</line>
    <line>My worst dream? Watching a SerpentsFang Assassin slip through the shadows, murdering my sister. Ask me about murder, if you must.</line>

    <line>It was the SerpentsFang Assassins who took her. My sister, gone in a hiss and a heartbeat.</line>

  <entry keyword="job">
    <line>My life? A ceaseless study of the venomous. Serpents, especially those called Executioners.</line>
    <line>Some call me an ophidian scholar, others a snake-mad recluse. The truth? I hunt knowledge... and vengeance.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="serpent">
    <line>Serpents: graceful and cruel, ancient as the first sin. But none as wicked as the Executioner breed.</line>
    <line>To most, a serpent is a warning. To me, it is a riddle with fangs.</line>
    <line>I would teach you about their kind—ask me about Executioners, if you dare to know more.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="executioner">
    <line>The SerpentsFangHighExecutioner is no mere beast. It is death made flesh—a legend among monsters.</line>
    <line>They are larger than nightmares, smarter than thieves. Their venom stains the soil black.</line>
    <line>Most flee at the name. But I have reason for hatred. Ask me about my mentor, if you wish the truth.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="mentor">
    <line>My mentor, Master Ulric, was the world’s foremost chronicler of serpent lore. Until the Executioner found him.</line>
    <line>Ulric’s wisdom was unmatched—he taught me everything I know. One night, he vanished, and only scales and a torn book remained.</line>
    <line>The Executioner devoured his body—and his work. All I have left are fragments. Ask me about the bestiary he lost.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bestiary">
    <line>The bestiary was Ulric’s life’s work—every serpent known to man, sketched and described. The Executioner destroyed it.</line>
    <line>I salvaged only scraps: tales of venom, diagrams of fangs. The final chapter was never written.</line>
    <line>I would finish it, if I could. But first—vengeance. If you wish to help, ask me about vengeance.</line>

  <!-- Red Herrings / Flavor Entries (24) -->
  <entry keyword="fang">
    <line>The Executioner’s fang is curved, hollow—fit for milking venom. I’ve seen one pierce steel.</line>
    <line>Once, I tried to collect a fang for study. I still have the scars. And the nightmares.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="venom">
    <line>Their venom burns flesh, blackens earth, and can dissolve a man’s courage in seconds.</line>
    <line>I’ve bottled Executioner venom. It corroded the glass and nearly cost me my hand.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scale">
    <line>Each scale glimmers like obsidian. Some fools wear serpent scale as armor, but I know it brings only curses.</line>
    <line>The Executioner’s scales are tougher than boiled leather, sharp as razors on the edge.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shed">
    <line>Serpents shed their skins when they grow. The Executioner’s cast-off shell is longer than a man’s shadow at dusk.</line>
    <line>I once found a fresh shed, still warm. I ran the other way.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pit">
    <line>Snake pits are myth—unless you’ve seen an Executioner’s lair. Then you understand terror.</line>
    <line>Few return from the pits. I study from a distance.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="egg">
    <line>Serpent eggs are rare. The Executioner’s brood? Never seen. I suspect they eat their young.</line>
    <line>I would not recommend touching any egg you find in the marsh. Or anywhere, really.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="marsh">
    <line>The Executioner prefers the marsh—dank, misty, silent. It strikes where footsteps vanish in mud.</line>
    <line>I lost a boot and a friend in those marshes. I miss the boot most days.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="poison">
    <line>People confuse poison and venom. Poison is for cowards; venom is for artists.</line>
    <line>I studied poisons once, but after my first taste of serpent venom, I learned humility.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="hiss">
    <line>The hiss of the Executioner is a warning. I once heard it, and the next thing I recall was waking up miles away, running.</line>
    <line>Some believe the hiss is a spell. I believe it’s a promise.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shed skin">
    <line>The Executioner’s shed skin is rumored to bring luck—if you survive taking it.</line>
    <line>I once used a piece as a bookmark. It crawled away in the night.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="prey">
    <line>Executioners choose their prey carefully: the slow, the careless, the overconfident.</line>
    <line>Once, I saw one stalk a deer for hours, then vanish when I blinked.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="cloak">
    <line>Some assassins wear serpent-skin cloaks. I prefer not to invite death to dinner.</line>
    <line>There’s a tale of a cloak that made the wearer invisible—until the Executioner found them.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="tongue">
    <line>The serpent’s tongue tastes the air for secrets. I wish I could do the same.</line>
    <line>Forked tongues are for speaking in riddles and lies. And finding lunch.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="bite">
    <line>The Executioner’s bite is not always fatal. Sometimes, it’s just humiliating.</line>
    <line>I’d rather face a swordsman than a hungry serpent. At least swordsmen don’t swallow you whole.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scroll">
    <line>Ulric’s bestiary was full of scrolls—now, only scraps remain.</line>
    <line>If you find a scroll in the marsh, best leave it be. Or dry it carefully. Or run.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="shadow">
    <line>They move like shadows—silent, cold, and gone before you know they’re there.</line>
    <line>I have chased more shadows than serpents. Both leave me empty-handed.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scale oil">
    <line>Some alchemists render oil from serpent scales. It’s rare, valuable, and almost certainly cursed.</line>
    <line>I once spilled some on my hands. My skin glittered for days—and the serpents watched me with interest.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="night">
    <line>Night is the Executioner’s favorite hour. They glide through moonlight as if born of it.</line>
    <line>Sleep lightly, traveler. Serpents respect no lock, and no curfew.</line>

  <entry keyword="legend">
    <line>They say the first Executioner was a demon’s pet, unleashed for betrayal.</line>

  </entry>

  <entry keyword="scale dust">
    <line>Grind their scales to dust, and you’ll have a fine glitter for potions—or funerals.</line>
    <line>Some merchants sell scale dust as a cure for baldness. I remain skeptical.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="torch">
    <line>A torch keeps lesser serpents at bay. The Executioner, sadly, enjoys the light—it means dinner is served.</line>
    <line>Bring a torch to the marsh, and you’ll only help them see you better.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="pet">
    <line>Some fools try to keep Executioners as pets. Fools, or very unlucky heirs.</line>
    <line>I once tried to tame a garter snake. It fled. I envy its good sense.</line>
  </entry>

  <entry keyword="treasure">
    <line>There are stories of treasures hidden in serpent nests. Most who seek them become treasure themselves.</line>

  <entry keyword="loss">
    <line>I lost my wife not to death, but to forgetting. A Shade stole her shadow, and with it, my memories of her smile.</line>

  <entry keyword="legend">
    <line>There are legends of a serpent so old, its scales are worn smooth by time. Silver, of course.</line>
